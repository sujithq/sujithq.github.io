&lt;p>Platform engineering is no longer a buzzword: itâ€™s a proven practice that bridges the gap between developers and operations by building Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs). As &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/what-is-platform-engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner&lt;/a> predicts, by 2026, 80% of large software engineering organisations will establish platform engineering teams as internal providers of reusable services, components, and tools for application delivery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>Platform Engineering Certified Practitioner&lt;/strong> course equips engineers, architects, and technology leaders with the knowledge and hands-on frameworks to design, build, and scale successful platforms inside their organisations.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
