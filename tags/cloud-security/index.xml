&lt;p>Azure environments can grow fast—across teams, business units, and global regions. With that growth comes the need for efficient governance. While Azure Management Groups and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) help organize and secure resources, Azure now offers an even more granular and flexible capability: &lt;strong>Azure Service Groups&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It’s no secret that the cloud has fundamentally changed how we approach cybersecurity. The days when a robust firewall was all you needed to keep attackers at bay are long gone. As cloud-native services increasingly move into the public sphere, identity has emerged as the new defensive perimeter—if an attacker compromises your identities and credentials, they’re essentially inside.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-identities-matter-more-than-ever">Why Identities Matter More Than Ever&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you’ve participated in a cybersecurity roundtable recently, you’ve likely heard someone mention, “Identity is the new perimeter.” Historically, once you were inside a corporate network, you had broad access to internal systems—much like walking through a front door and freely wandering the house. However, the widespread adoption of cloud services—accessible from anywhere—has turned this model upside down.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
