Kubenet Networking for Azure Kubernetes Service Retires on March 31, 2028
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) will officially retire kubenet networking on March 31, 2028. After this date, workloads using kubenet will no longer be supported, so it's essential to migrate in advance to avoid disruptions. Microsoft recommends transitioning to Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) overlay, which offers the same IP address overlay architecture as kubenet while providing improved scalability and new capabilities. Follow the upgrade guide to ensure a smooth migration before the deadline.
