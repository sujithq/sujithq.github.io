Welcome to the Azure Changelog, your go-to source for the latest updates and enhancements in Microsoft Azure. In this edition, we will cover the most recent changes and improvements made to Azure services, tools, and features. Stay informed about the latest developments in the Azure ecosystem to optimize your cloud experience.

### Kubenet Networking for Azure Kubernetes Service Retires on March 31, 2028  

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) will officially retire **kubenet networking** on **March 31, 2028**. After this date, workloads using kubenet will no longer be supported, so it's essential to migrate in advance to avoid disruptions.  

Microsoft recommends transitioning to **Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) overlay**, which offers the same IP address overlay architecture as kubenet while providing improved scalability and new capabilities. Follow the [upgrade guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/upgrade-aks-ipam-and-dataplane) to ensure a smooth migration before the deadline.

- **March 31, 2028** – All Azure Spring Apps plans will be **fully retired**, and instances will no longer be accessible.
