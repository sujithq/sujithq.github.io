## Part 7: Testing and Debugging Async Code

You‚Äôve learned how to *write* async code ‚Äî but how do you **test** it and **debug** it when things go wrong? Async introduces unique challenges: hidden continuations, exceptions in background tasks, and ‚Äúlost‚Äù operations. Let‚Äôs tackle them.

---

## Writing Async Unit Tests

Most modern test frameworks (xUnit, NUnit, MSTest) fully support async tests.

‚úÖ Correct:

```csharp
[Fact] // xUnit
public async Task GetNumberAsync_Returns42()
{
    var result = await GetNumberAsync();
    Assert.Equal(42, result);
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid this (blocks async code and may deadlock):

```csharp
[Fact]
public void BadTest()
{
    var result = GetNumberAsync().Result; // ‚ùå
    Assert.Equal(42, result);
}
```

**Rule**: Your test method should return `Task` if it calls async code.

---

## Mocking Async Methods

When testing async code, you‚Äôll often need to mock dependencies.

Example with **Moq**:

```csharp
var mockRepo = new Mock<IUserRepository>();
mockRepo.Setup(r => r.GetUserAsync(It.IsAny<int>()))
        .ReturnsAsync(new User { Id = 1, Name = "Alice" });

var service = new UserService(mockRepo.Object);
var user = await service.GetUserAsync(1);

Assert.Equal("Alice", user.Name);
```

Here, `ReturnsAsync` makes it easy to simulate async results.

---

## Testing Multiple Tasks and Exceptions

When using `Task.WhenAll`, multiple exceptions are aggregated. Test them explicitly:

```csharp
var t1 = FailsAsync();
var t2 = FailsAsync();

var ex = await Assert.ThrowsAsync<AggregateException>(async () => await Task.WhenAll(t1, t2));
Assert.Equal(2, ex.InnerExceptions.Count);
```

Or unwrap with `try/catch`:

```csharp
try
{
    await Task.WhenAll(t1, t2);
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    // e is AggregateException in .NET Framework, but flattens to first inner in .NET Core when awaited; check tasks for details
    var errors = new[] { t1.Exception, t2.Exception };
}
```

---

## Debugging Async Code in Visual Studio

Async stacks can look confusing, but Visual Studio helps:

- **Tasks Window** (`Debug > Windows > Parallel Tasks`)  
  Shows all active tasks, their status, and call stacks.

- **Async Call Stacks** (`Debug > Options > Enable Just My Code` and ensure "Show Async Call Stack")  
  Preserves the logical async flow across awaits.

- **Configure Breakpoints**  
  Use conditions and actions to break when a specific `OperationId` or correlation ID is present in logs.

---

## Tracing Async Flows with Logging and `Activity`

Logging is critical to see what‚Äôs happening between awaits.

Example with `ILogger` (ASP.NET Core):

```csharp
public async Task ProcessAsync(ILogger logger, CancellationToken ct)
{
    logger.LogInformation("Starting work");
    await Task.Delay(1000, ct);
    logger.LogInformation("Work complete");
}
```

For cross-service tracing, use `System.Diagnostics.Activity` (and OpenTelemetry if available):

```csharp
using var activity = new Activity("FetchCustomer")
    .AddTag("customer.id", id.ToString());
activity.Start();

var customer = await repo.GetCustomerAsync(id, ct);

activity.Stop();
```

With OpenTelemetry exporters (Jaeger, Zipkin, OTLP), you can see async spans stitched together.

---

## Handling Unobserved and Fire‚Äëand‚ÄëForget Exceptions

Async tasks can fail silently if you forget to await them. .NET raises `TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException`, but it‚Äôs often too late and can be GC‚Äëdependent.

‚úÖ Patterns that help:

```csharp
// 1) Prefer awaiting
await DoWorkAsync();

// 2) If fire-and-forget is necessary, capture errors
_ = Task.Run(async () =>
{
    try
    {
        await DoWorkAsync();
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        logger.LogError(ex, "Background task failed");
    }
});
```

In libraries, consider returning an **`IAsyncDisposable`** that manages background lifetimes so callers can dispose and observe errors on shutdown.

---

## Deterministic Tests with Time and Cancellation

Make tests reliable by controlling time and tokens:

- Pass a **`CancellationToken`** into your methods and cancel in tests to assert behavior.  
- Abstract timers/delays behind an interface so you can fake time in tests (e.g., wrap `Task.Delay` behind `ITimer.DelayAsync`).

Example fake timer:

```csharp
public interface ITimer
{
    Task Delay(TimeSpan delay, CancellationToken ct = default);
}

public sealed class RealTimer : ITimer
{
    public Task Delay(TimeSpan delay, CancellationToken ct = default) => Task.Delay(delay, ct);
}

public sealed class FakeTimer : ITimer
{
    public TaskCompletionSource Completed { get; } = new();
    public Task Delay(TimeSpan delay, CancellationToken ct = default) => Completed.Task;
}
```

---

## Common Testing Smells (and Fixes)

- **Using `.Result`/`.Wait()` in tests** ‚Üí switch to `async Task` tests.  
- **Races on shared state** ‚Üí isolate state per test or use fixtures with fresh instances.  
- **Flaky tests due to real network/IO** ‚Üí mock or use local test servers/files.  
- **Hidden deadlocks** ‚Üí remove context capture in test targets (`ConfigureAwait(false)` in libraries).

---

## Key Takeaways

- Test methods should be `async Task` ‚Äî never block on async.  
- Use mocking frameworks‚Äô async helpers (`ReturnsAsync`) to simulate work.  
- Visual Studio‚Äôs Tasks and Async Call Stacks make async debugging tractable.  
- Add structured logging and activities for traceability across awaits.  
- Treat fire‚Äëand‚Äëforget carefully; capture and log exceptions.
