This guide shows how to build a privacy-first AI energy assistant using C#, the open-source GPT-OSS-20B model, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and custom tool calling. The assistant analyzes solar, gas, and weather data completely offline, with no cloud dependencies.

Features:
- Solar production analysis
- Gas usage intelligence
- Grid import/export insights
- Weather context
- Tool-based actions via natural language
- Complete privacy: all data processed locally

Setup:
- .NET SDK 9+ installed
- For testing: GitHub Models platform
- For production: Ollama for local LLMs
- Energy data in JSON format

Why GPT-OSS?
- Open-source, permissive license
- Optimized for local deployment
- Advanced capabilities for energy analysis

Flexible deployment:
- Development: GitHub Models for model comparison
- Production: Ollama for privacy and control

Sample queries:
- "When did I generate the most solar power?"
- "How does cold weather affect my gas usage?"
- "Show me details for August 2nd"

Security and privacy:
- Development mode: test data only
- Production mode: all data stays local

Advanced extensions:
- Weather integration
- Smart home integration
- Machine learning analytics

Best practices:
- Regular backups
- Data validation
- Performance optimization
- Model management

Next steps:
- Add configuration management, visualization, real-time integration, advanced AI, enterprise features, and mobile support.
