## Skills Measured: Complete Domain Breakdown

Let's dive deep into each domain, covering every skill you need for exam success.

## Domain 1: Introduction to Git and GitHub (22%)

This is the largest domain, focusing on fundamental Git concepts and GitHub navigation.

### Understanding Git Basics

#### What Git Is

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in files and coordinates work among multiple people. Key concepts:

- **Repository (Repo)**: A directory containing your project files and Git metadata
- **Commit**: A snapshot of your project at a specific point in time
- **Branch**: A parallel version of your repository
- **Merge**: Combining changes from different branches

#### Basic Git Workflow

The fundamental Git workflow follows this pattern:

1. **Modify** files in your working directory
2. **Stage** changes using `git add`
3. **Commit** staged changes using `git commit`
4. **Push** commits to remote repository using `git push`

```bash
# Example workflow
git add filename.txt        # Stage specific file
git add .                   # Stage all changes
git commit -m "Add new feature"  # Commit with message
git push origin main        # Push to remote repository
```

#### Local vs Remote Repositories

- **Local Repository**: Exists on your computer, contains complete project history
- **Remote Repository**: Hosted on GitHub (or other platforms), enables collaboration
- **Clone**: Creates local copy of remote repository
- **Fork**: Creates your own copy of someone else's repository

### Essential Git Commands

#### Repository Initialisation and Cloning

```bash
# Initialise new repository
git init

# Clone existing repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

# Clone to specific directory
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git my-project
```

#### Basic File Operations

```bash
# Check repository status
git status

# Add files to staging area
git add filename.txt        # Specific file
git add *.js               # All JavaScript files
git add .                  # All changes

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
git commit -am "Add and commit in one step"  # For tracked files

# View commit history
git log
git log --oneline          # Compact format
git log --graph            # Visual representation
```

#### Remote Repository Operations

```bash
# Add remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git

# View remote repositories
git remote -v

# Push changes to remote
git push origin main       # Push to main branch
git push -u origin main    # Set upstream tracking

# Pull changes from remote
git pull origin main       # Fetch and merge
git fetch origin          # Fetch without merging
```

#### Branching and Merging

```bash
# Create new branch
git branch feature-branch
git checkout -b feature-branch  # Create and switch

# Switch branches
git checkout main
git switch feature-branch      # Modern alternative

# List branches
git branch                 # Local branches
git branch -r             # Remote branches
git branch -a             # All branches

# Merge branches
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch

# Delete branch
git branch -d feature-branch   # Delete merged branch
git branch -D feature-branch   # Force delete
```

### Navigating GitHub

**Account Creation and Setup**
Understanding GitHub account types and initial setup:

- **Personal Account**: Free tier includes unlimited public/private repositories

- **Search functionality**: Code search, repository search, user search

#### Issues and Pull Requests Fundamentals

**Issues** are used for:

- Bug reports and feature requests
- Task tracking and project planning
- Discussions and questions

**Pull Requests** enable:

- Code review processes
- Collaborative development
- Merge approval workflows

## Domain 2: Working with GitHub Repositories (8%)

This domain focuses on practical repository management skills.

### Managing Repository Settings

**Repository Configuration**
Essential settings you need to understand:

```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml example
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
```

**Access and Permissions**
Repository permission levels:

- **Read**: View and clone repository
- **Triage**: Manage issues and pull requests
- **Write**: Push changes and manage some settings
- **Maintain**: Manage repository without access to sensitive actions
- **Admin**: Full repository access

**Repository Templates**
Creating reusable repository structures:

- Template repositories for consistent project setup
- Including standard files: README, LICENSE, .gitignore
- Automated repository creation from templates

### Working with Files

**Adding and Editing Files**
Multiple methods for file management:

**Via GitHub Web Interface**:

1. Navigate to repository
2. Click "Add file" or "Create new file"
3. Edit content using built-in editor
4. Commit changes directly

**Via Git Commands**:

```bash
# Create new file
touch newfile.txt
echo "Content" > newfile.txt

# Edit existing file (using editor)
nano README.md
vim config.json

# Stage and commit
git add newfile.txt
git commit -m "Add new configuration file"
```

**File Versioning**
Understanding file history and versioning:

- **Blame view**: See who changed each line and when
- **History view**: Complete change history for files
- **Diff view**: Compare different versions

**GitHub Desktop Integration**
Key features of GitHub Desktop:

- Visual diff representation
- Simplified branching and merging
- Sync with GitHub repositories
- Conflict resolution interface

## Domain 3: Collaboration Features (30%)

This is the most substantial domain, covering GitHub's collaborative capabilities.

### GitHub Collaboration Workflows

**Forking Repositories**
The fork workflow is essential for open source contribution:

1. **Fork** the original repository to your account
2. **Clone** your fork locally
3. **Create** a feature branch
4. **Make** changes and commit
5. **Push** to your fork
6. **Create** pull request to original repository

```bash
# Complete fork workflow example
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/forked-repo.git
cd forked-repo
git checkout -b feature-improvement
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Implement feature improvement"
git push origin feature-improvement
# Create PR via GitHub interface
```

#### Pull Request Lifecycle

**Creating Pull Requests**:

- Clear title and description

### GitHub Actions for CI/CD

**Basic GitHub Actions Concepts**
GitHub Actions automates software workflows:

- **Workflow**: Automated process triggered by events
- **Job**: Set of steps executed on same runner
- **Step**: Individual task within job
- **Action**: Reusable unit of code

**Simple Workflow Example**:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: Continuous Integration

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
      
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
```

**Common Workflow Triggers**:

- `push`: Code pushed to repository
- `pull_request`: Pull request created or updated
- `schedule`: Time-based triggers
- `workflow_dispatch`: Manual trigger

### Project Management with GitHub

- When issue is labeled "bug" → Set priority to "High"
```

### Integration with Issues and Pull Requests

**Linking Work Items**
Connecting projects to development work:

```markdown
# In issue or PR description
Closes #123
