This blog post captures my notes from the AZ-700 course, which is designed to teach Network Engineers how to design, implement, and maintain Azure networking solutions. The course covers a wide range of networking topics, including:

- Designing, implementing, and managing core Azure networking infrastructure
- Hybrid networking connections for on-premises integration
- Load balancing strategies for optimizing traffic distribution
- Routing and private access to Azure services
- Network security and traffic filtering
- Monitoring and troubleshooting network connectivity

Virtual Networks (VNets)
Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) are the backbone of networking in Azure, allowing resources to communicate securely.

VNet Capabilities
Azure VNets support:
- Communication with the internet
- Communication between Azure resources
- Secure connectivity to on-premises networks
- Traffic filtering using NSGs (Network Security Groups)
- Routing network traffic efficiently

VNet Address Space
Azure VNets use private IP address ranges as defined in RFC 1918:
- 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8)
- 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12)
- 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16)

Subnet Allocation
Azure reserves 5 IPs per subnet:
- x.x.x.0: Network address
- x.x.x.1: Default gateway
- x.x.x.2 & x.x.x.3: Azure DNS mapping
- x.x.x.255: Broadcast address

Scopes in Azure
In Azure, every resource must have a unique name within its defined scope. Scopes are hierarchical:
1. Global (e.g., Storage Accounts)
2. Management Group
3. Subscription
4. Resource Group (e.g., VNets)
5. Resource (individual resource instances)

Regions & Availability Zones
Resources in a VNet must be in the same region, but cross-region connectivity is possible. VNets can be linked across different subscriptions.
Availability Zones provide high availability by distributing resources across physically separate data centers within a region.
- Zonal Services: Resources pinned to a specific zone
- Zone-Redundant Services: Automatically replicated across zones
- Non-Regional Services: Resilient to zone-wide and region-wide failures

Public IPs in Azure
Public IPs enable external communication for Azure resources. They can be static (unchanging) or dynamic (reassigned upon restart).
- Basic SKU: Static/Dynamic, open by default, no AZ support
- Standard SKU: Static only, secure by default (NSG required), zone-redundant

DNS Resolution in Azure
Azure provides both public and private DNS services to resolve domain names.
- Public DNS: Manages internet-facing domain names (A/AAAA/CNAME records)
- Private DNS: Internal name resolution within VNets (Private Zones, Azure-provided, Custom DNS)
Azure's built-in DNS resolver: 168.63.129.16
DNS forwarding allows on-premises resources to resolve Azure hostnames, ensuring seamless hybrid connectivity.

VNet Peering for Cross-Network Connectivity
Azure VNet Peering allows seamless communication between VNets without a VPN.
- Regional Peering: Same Azure region, high bandwidth, low latency
- Global Peering: Cross-region, uses Azure backbone
Benefits: Secure private communication, no internet exposure, no need for VPN gateways, supports NSGs, works across subscriptions and tenants

Gateway Transit for Shared VPN Access
Gateway Transit allows one VNet to use another VNetâ€™s VPN gateway for cross-premises connectivity. Use case: A hub-and-spoke topology where a single gateway in the hub VNet provides VPN access to multiple spokes.

Azure Traffic Routing
Azure manages traffic routing through:
- System Routes: Default routes created by Azure (Internet traffic via Internet Gateway, private traffic stays within VNet)
- Custom Routes (UDRs): Use route tables to override system routes (e.g., direct traffic to a firewall appliance)

Default Route Table:
- Source: Default, Destination: 0.0.0.0/0, Next Hop: Internet
- Source: Default, Destination: 10.0.0.0/8, Next Hop: None
- Source: Default, Destination: 192.168.0.0/16, Next Hop: None

Final Thoughts
This post provides a comprehensive summary of key Azure networking concepts from AZ-700. Understanding VNets, peering, DNS, and routing is essential for designing scalable, secure, and high-performing cloud networks.
Key Takeaways:
- Master VNet and subnet design to optimize address space
- Use peering and gateway transit for hybrid connectivity
- Leverage DNS solutions to simplify name resolution
- Control traffic with NSGs & UDRs for security and compliance
If you're studying for AZ-700, focus on hands-on labs to reinforce concepts!
