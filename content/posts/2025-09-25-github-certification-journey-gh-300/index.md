### Lab 3: Advanced Prompt Engineering and AI Optimization

Create sophisticated prompt engineering frameworks and AI optimization strategies.

**Objectives:**

- Develop advanced prompt engineering techniques
- Implement AI model optimization strategies
- Create prompt evaluation and improvement systems

**Advanced Prompt Engineering System:**

```typescript
// Advanced prompt engineering and optimization system
interface PromptEngineering {
  pattern: string;
  context: ContextStrategy;

  evaluation: EvaluationMetrics;
}

class AdvancedPromptEngineeringSystem {
  private promptPatterns: Map<string, PromptPattern>;
  private contextStrategies: ContextStrategy[];
  private evaluationMetrics: EvaluationFramework;
  
  constructor() {
    this.initializePromptPatterns();
    this.setupEvaluationFramework();
  }
  
  async engineerOptimalPrompt(task: DevelopmentTask): Promise<OptimizedPrompt> {
    // Analyze task requirements
    const taskAnalysis = await this.analyzeTask(task);
    
    // Select appropriate prompt pattern
    const pattern = this.selectPromptPattern(taskAnalysis);
    
    // Build context-rich prompt
    const contextualPrompt = await this.buildContextualPrompt(pattern, task);
    
    // Optimize for AI model performance
    const optimizedPrompt = await this.optimizeForModel(contextualPrompt);
    
    // Evaluate prompt quality
    const qualityScore = await this.evaluatePromptQuality(optimizedPrompt);
    
    return {
      prompt: optimizedPrompt,
      pattern: pattern.name,
      qualityScore,
      estimatedTokens: this.estimateTokenUsage(optimizedPrompt),
      expectedOutput: this.predictOutput(optimizedPrompt)
    };
  }
  
  private async buildContextualPrompt(pattern: PromptPattern, task: DevelopmentTask): Promise<string> {
    const contextBuilder = new ContextBuilder();
    
    // Add technical context
    contextBuilder.addTechnicalContext({
      language: task.programmingLanguage,
      framework: task.framework,
      architecture: task.architecturalPattern,
      constraints: task.technicalConstraints
    });
    
    // Add business context
    contextBuilder.addBusinessContext({
      domain: task.businessDomain,
      requirements: task.functionalRequirements,
      goals: task.businessGoals
    });
    
    // Add quality context
    contextBuilder.addQualityContext({
      performanceRequirements: task.performanceTargets,
      securityRequirements: task.securityConstraints,
      maintainabilityGoals: task.maintainabilityTargets
    });
    
    return pattern.template.render(contextBuilder.build());
  }
}

      Task: {task_description}
      
      Let's approach this systematically:
      
      1. Problem Analysis:
         - What exactly needs to be accomplished?
         - What are the key challenges?
         - What constraints must we consider?
      
      2. Solution Design:
         - What approach will work best?
         - How should we structure the solution?
         - What patterns or best practices apply?
      
      3. Implementation Plan:
         - What are the key components?
         - How will they interact?
         - What libraries or frameworks should we use?
      
      4. Quality Assurance:
         - How will we ensure correctness?
         - What tests are needed?
         - How will we handle edge cases?
      
      Context: {technical_context}
      Requirements: {requirements}
      Constraints: {constraints}
      
      Please provide a complete, well-documented solution.
    `,
    useCases: ["complex_algorithms", "system_design", "architecture_decisions"]
  },
  
  EXAMPLE_DRIVEN: {
    name: "Example-Driven Development", 
    template: `
      Create {target_description} following these patterns:
      
      Example 1:
      {example_1}
      
      Example 2:
      {example_2}
      
      Key patterns to follow:
      - {pattern_1}
      - {pattern_2}
      - {pattern_3}
      
      Now create: {specific_requirements}
      
      Ensure the solution:
      - Follows the established patterns
      - Maintains consistency with examples
      - Includes proper error handling
      - Has comprehensive documentation
    `,
    useCases: ["api_development", "component_libraries", "design_systems"]
  },
  
  CONSTRAINT_DRIVEN: {
    name: "Constraint-Driven Development",
    template: `
      Develop {solution_description} with these specific constraints:
      
      Technical Constraints:
      {technical_constraints}
      
      Performance Constraints:
      {performance_constraints}
      
      Security Constraints:
      {security_constraints}
      
      Business Constraints:
      {business_constraints}
      
      The solution must:
      1. Satisfy all constraints explicitly
      2. Provide reasoning for design decisions
      3. Include fallback strategies for constraint violations
      4. Demonstrate constraint validation
