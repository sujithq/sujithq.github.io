GitHub Copilot just levelled up. The long-anticipated **Agent Mode** is no longer in preview and is officially rolling out to all users of **Visual Studio Code**, including the stable release. If you've ever dreamed of having a truly **autonomous AI pair programmer** that doesn't just suggest lines of code but actively edits files, runs commands, and debugs your code — your wish has come true.

## 💡 What is Copilot Agent Mode?

Agent Mode is a major upgrade to GitHub Copilot. Unlike traditional autocomplete and inline suggestions, **Agent Mode enables Copilot to understand your workspace and perform complex, multi-step tasks** — from generating code to fixing bugs, running tests, editing multiple files, and executing terminal commands.

Think of it like a smart intern who can not only follow your instructions but also proactively solve problems with minimal handholding.

## 🧠 What Can It Do?

Here are just a few of the tasks Agent Mode can perform:

- 🔧 **Refactor legacy code** to modern frameworks  
- 🚀 **Bootstrap applications from scratch** using your tech stack  
- 🧪 **Write and execute tests**, then fix failing ones  
- 📄 **Generate documentation** for existing code  
- 📦 **Integrate new libraries** and modify config files  
- 🖍️ **Suggest code edits across multiple files**

It’s not just executing commands — it's thinking, iterating, and reacting like a teammate.

## ⚙️ How Does It Work?

Agent Mode uses a system of tools to reason about your code:

- **Workspace search** to understand file structure
- **Code edits** proposed in response to your request
- **Terminal commands** to build, test, and lint
- **Context awareness**, with optional user-specified files (`#file`) or drag-and-drop UI

It breaks down your request, reasons about the next steps, and executes them — reviewing and retrying when needed.

## 🛠️ How To Enable It in VS Code

Agent Mode is available in **VS Code Insiders** and **Stable** as of April 2025.

Here’s how to get started:

1. ✅ **Enable Agent Mode**  
   Open the Settings UI and enable:  
   `GitHub > Copilot: Enable Chat Agent Mode` (`chat.agent.enabled`)

2. 💬 **Open the Copilot Chat**  
   Use the shortcut <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+I</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd+Ctrl+I</kbd> on macOS), or click the GitHub Copilot icon.

3. 🔄 **Switch to Agent Mode**  
   In the dropdown menu next to your chat input, select **Agent** instead of Chat or Inline.

4. ✍️ **Type your task**  
   Try something like:  
   _"Convert this Express app to use Fastify and update the unit tests."_

## 🤹‍♀️ When to Use Agent Mode (vs. Edit Mode)

Use **Agent Mode** when:

- Your task spans multiple files
- You need terminal commands executed (like `npm run build`)
- You're looking for iterative problem-solving

Use **Edit Mode** when:

- You want focused changes to a single file or snippet
- The task is well-scoped and you want to review before applying

## 🚧 What’s Coming Next?

The Copilot team is already working on enhancements:

- ⏪ **Better undo** support for changes
- 🧱 **Improved terminal visibility** and error feedback
- 📓 **Notebook integration** for Jupyter-style workflows
- 🧠 **More granular context control** to help Copilot focus

## 📎 Final Thoughts

GitHub Copilot Agent Mode is a glimpse into the future of software development. It’s no longer just a tool to speed up typing — it’s a collaborator that understands your code, runs it, tests it, and fixes it. This is the kind of developer experience we’ve been waiting for.

So fire up Visual Studio Code, switch on Agent Mode, and start building like it’s 2030. Your AI teammate is ready to work.
