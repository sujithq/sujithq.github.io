If you’ve enabled **Dependabot**, you probably love the automated updates but not the **PR storm** and the **merge conflicts** that happen when several PRs touch the same lockfiles or project files.

The cure is **Dependabot Groups**: batch related updates into a single PR so you merge once and move on.

---

## Why conflicts happen

- **npm**: multiple PRs each rewrite `package-lock.json`.
- **NuGet**: several PRs change the same `.csproj` / `packages.lock.json`.
- **GitHub Actions**: many small PRs bumping actions across several workflow files.

Merge one PR → the others go stale → conflicts or repeated rebases.

---

## The fix: group by ecosystem & update type

- Batch **minor/patch** together (usually safe).
- Keep **majors** separate (often need code changes).
- Optionally **group security updates** for quick handling.
- Limit concurrency with `open-pull-requests-limit`.

---

## Drop-in config: npm, NuGet & GitHub Actions

Create or edit `.github/dependabot.yml`:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  # npm (package.json / lockfile)
  - package-ecosystem: npm
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: weekly
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
    groups:
      npm-minor-patch:
        patterns: ["*"]
        update-types: ["minor", "patch"]
      npm-majors:
        patterns: ["*"]
        update-types: ["major"]
      npm-security:
        applies-to: security-updates
        patterns: ["*"]

  # NuGet (.csproj, .props, .targets, packages.lock.json)
  - package-ecosystem: nuget
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: weekly
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
    groups:
      nuget-minor-patch:
        patterns: ["*"]
        update-types: ["minor", "patch"]
      nuget-majors:
        patterns: ["*"]
        update-types: ["major"]
      nuget-security:
        applies-to: security-updates
        patterns: ["*"]

  # GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/*.yml)
  - package-ecosystem: github-actions
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: weekly
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
    groups:
      actions-all:
        patterns: ["*"]            # one PR for all action bumps
      actions-security:
        applies-to: security-updates
        patterns: ["*"]
```

## Special notes for **GitHub Actions**

- **One PR, many workflows**: Grouping will update **all matching workflows** in one PR (e.g., bump `actions/checkout` across multiple files together).
- **Version style**: Dependabot follows **tags** you use in `uses:` (e.g., `@v4` or `@v4.1.0`). Using major tags (`@v4`) gives you a steady cadence of safe bumps.
- **Security posture**: Many teams pin to major tags (easier updates) or to exact versions. If you pin to **commit SHAs**, you won’t receive normal semver/tag updates, review your policy and decide which approach fits your supply-chain requirements.
- **Noise reduction**: Toolchain bursts (e.g., `actions/setup-node`, `setup-dotnet`, `checkout`, `upload-artifact`) are where grouping shines, one tidy PR instead of five.
- **Still stale?** Comment `@dependabot rebase` on the PR to refresh after other merges.

---

## Tips that save time

- **Cadence**: Weekly works well-predictable and batch-friendly.
- **Lockfile only (npm)**: For infra repos, consider `versioning-strategy: lockfile-only`.
- **Per-folder repos**: Add additional `updates` blocks with different `directory` values if you have multiple package roots.
- **PR hygiene**: Keep `open-pull-requests-limit` low to avoid “PR storms”.

---

## Troubleshooting quick hits

- **“Why didn’t X get grouped?”**  
  Check the `patterns` and `update-types`. Majors won’t join a minor/patch group.
- **“Why so many Actions PRs?”**  
  Ensure the `github-actions` ecosystem has a `groups:` block (see above).
- **“Conflicts anyway?”**  
  If another large change touched the same files, trigger a rebase (`@dependabot rebase`). Grouping minimizes, but can’t eliminate, all conflicts.
