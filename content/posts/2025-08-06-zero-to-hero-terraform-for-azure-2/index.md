## Introduction

In [Part 1](../../03/zero-to-hero-terraform-for-azure-1/), we set up our development environment and deployed our first Azure resource group using Terraform. Whilst this gave us a taste of Infrastructure as Code, we were using local state files: a practice that won't scale for team environments or production workloads.

In this second part of our series, we'll explore **Terraform state management** and **remote backends**. You'll learn why state is crucial, how to configure Azure Storage as a remote backend, implement state locking for team safety, and master essential state management commands.

By the end of this post, you'll have production-ready state management that enables secure team collaboration and robust infrastructure management.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have:

- Completed [Part 1](../../03/zero-to-hero-terraform-for-azure-1/) of this series
- Terraform and Azure CLI installed and configured
- An active Azure subscription
- Basic understanding of Azure resource groups and storage accounts

## Understanding Terraform State

### What is Terraform State?

Terraform state is a JSON file that maps your configuration files to real-world resources. It serves as Terraform's "memory" of what infrastructure exists and how it relates to your configuration.

When you ran `terraform apply` in Part 1, Terraform created a file called `terraform.tfstate` in your working directory. Let's examine what's inside:

```bash
# Navigate to your terraform-azure directory from Part 1
cd terraform-azure

# View the state file (if it exists)
cat terraform.tfstate
```

The state file contains crucial information:

- Resource metadata and attributes
- Resource dependencies
- Provider configuration details
- Resource addresses and unique identifiers

### Why State Matters

Terraform state is essential for several reasons:

1. **Performance**: State caching avoids costly API calls to cloud providers
2. **Collaboration**: Teams need shared state to avoid conflicts
3. **Metadata Storage**: State stores resource metadata not available via APIs
4. **Resource Mapping**: Links configuration to real infrastructure
5. **Dependency Tracking**: Maintains resource relationship information

### Local State Limitations

Storing state locally creates several problems:

- **No Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can't share state
- **No Locking**: Concurrent operations can corrupt state
- **No Backup**: Local files can be lost or corrupted
- **Security Risk**: Sensitive data stored in local files
- **No Audit Trail**: No history of infrastructure changes

## Setting Up Azure Storage Remote Backend

### Step 1: Create Azure Storage Resources

Let's create the Azure resources needed for remote state storage.

**Important Note**: Creating the storage account for Terraform state using Terraform itself creates a chicken-and-egg problem - you need a place to store state before you can manage infrastructure with Terraform. Unless you have a fully working landing zone system with existing state management, the storage account should be created using Azure CLI or other tools.

#### Option A: Azure CLI (Recommended for State Storage)

Create the backend storage using Azure CLI:

```bash
# Set variables for consistency
RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME="terraform-backend-rg"
STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME="tfstate$(openssl rand -hex 4)"  # Generates unique suffix
CONTAINER_NAME="tfstate"
LOCATION="West Europe"

# Create resource group
az group create \
  --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
  --location "$LOCATION"

# Create storage account
az storage account create \
  --name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME \
  --location "$LOCATION" \
  --sku Standard_LRS \
  --kind StorageV2 \
  --allow-blob-public-access false \
  --min-tls-version TLS1_2

# Create container
az storage container create \
  --name $CONTAINER_NAME \
  --account-name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME \
  --auth-mode login

# Display information for backend configuration
echo "Backend Configuration Details:"
echo "Resource Group: $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME"
echo "Storage Account: $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME"
echo "Container: $CONTAINER_NAME"
```

#### Option B: Terraform (For Other Infrastructure)

If you already have a backend storage solution or are creating infrastructure other than the state storage itself, you can use Terraform. Create a separate directory for this:

```bash
mkdir terraform-infrastructure
cd terraform-infrastructure
```

Create `infrastructure.tf` for your application resources:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
  
  # Configure remote backend (created via Azure CLI)
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "terraform-backend-rg"
    storage_account_name = "tfstate<your-suffix>"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "infrastructure/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
  # subscription_id is required in provider 4.0+
  # Set via ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID environment variable
}

# Example application infrastructure (NOT the backend storage)
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "app" {
  name     = "myapp-rg"
  location = "West Europe"
  
  tags = {
    Environment = "Development"
    ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "app" {
  name                     = "myapp${random_string.app_suffix.result}"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.app.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.app.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
  
  tags = {
    Environment = "Development"
    Purpose     = "Application"
  }
}

resource "random_string" "app_suffix" {
  length  = 8
  special = false
  upper   = false
}
```

#### Why This Approach Works

- **Backend Storage**: Created manually via Azure CLI (no circular dependency)
- **Application Infrastructure**: Managed by Terraform using the pre-existing backend
- **Clear Separation**: State storage is infrastructure foundation, everything else is managed code

Deploy the application infrastructure:

```bash
# Initialize and apply the infrastructure
terraform init
terraform apply
```

**Important**: Use the storage account name from the Azure CLI output in your backend configuration.

#### Enterprise Landing Zone Approach

In enterprise environments with established landing zones, you might have:

- **Centralised Backend Management**: Shared storage accounts managed by platform teams
- **Terraform Cloud/Enterprise**: Managed remote state solutions
- **Azure DevOps/GitHub**: Pipeline-managed backend configuration
- **Multi-Subscription Architecture**: Separate subscriptions for state management

For our learning series, the Azure CLI approach provides the cleanest foundation.

### Important: Azure RM Provider 4.0 Requirements

Azure RM provider 4.0 introduced stricter authentication requirements. You **must** specify a subscription ID using one of these methods:

#### Method 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)

```bash
# Set subscription ID via environment variable
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="your-subscription-id"

# Get your subscription ID if needed
az account show --query id --output tsv
```

#### Method 2: Provider Configuration (Not Recommended for Production)

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
  subscription_id = "your-subscription-id"  # Avoid hardcoding in production
}
```

#### Method 3: Azure CLI Default (Sometimes Works)

```bash
# Ensure you're logged in and have a default subscription
az login
az account set --subscription "your-subscription-id"
```

**Best Practice**: Always use environment variables (`ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`) to avoid hardcoding sensitive values in your Terraform configuration.

### Step 2: Configure Remote Backend

Now let's configure our Terraform project to use the remote backend. We'll work with our original `terraform-azure` directory:

```bash
cd ../terraform-azure
```

### Best Practice: Secure Backend Configuration

Rather than hardcoding backend configuration in `main.tf`, we'll use a secure approach that prevents the chicken-and-egg problem and improves security.

#### Clean Main Configuration

Update your `main.tf` to declare the backend without sensitive details:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
  
  # Partial backend configuration - details provided during init
  backend "azurerm" {}
}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
  # subscription_id is required in provider 4.0+
  # Set via ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID environment variable
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "terraform-rg"
  location = "West Europe"
}
```

#### Backend Configuration for CI/CD

Create `backend.hcl` for pipeline use (add to `.gitignore`):

```hcl
# backend.hcl - Used in CI/CD pipelines
resource_group_name  = "terraform-backend-rg"
storage_account_name = "tfstate<your-suffix>"
container_name       = "tfstate"
key                  = "terraform.tfstate"
```

#### Local Development Override

Create `override.tf` for local development (add to `.gitignore`):

```hcl
# override.tf - Local development only
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "terraform-backend-rg"
    storage_account_name = "tfstate<your-suffix>"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Migrate to Remote Backend

#### Option A: Local Development (using override)

If you created `override.tf`, simply initialise:

```bash
# Migrate existing state to remote backend
terraform init -migrate-state
```

#### Option B: CI/CD Pipeline (using backend config file)

In CI/CD pipelines, use the backend configuration file:

```bash
# Initialize with backend configuration file
terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl -migrate-state
```

#### Option C: Pipeline with Environment Variables

For even better security, use environment variables in pipelines:

```bash
# Set backend configuration via environment variables
export TF_VAR_resource_group_name="terraform-backend-rg"
export TF_VAR_storage_account_name="tfstate<your-suffix>"
export TF_VAR_container_name="tfstate"
export TF_VAR_key="terraform.tfstate"

# Initialize with backend config from environment
terraform init \
  -backend-config="resource_group_name=$TF_VAR_resource_group_name" \
  -backend-config="storage_account_name=$TF_VAR_storage_account_name" \
  -backend-config="container_name=$TF_VAR_container_name" \
  -backend-config="key=$TF_VAR_key" \
  -migrate-state
```

#### Verify Migration

Regardless of the method used, verify the migration:

```bash
# Check that state is now remote
terraform state list
```

You should see your existing resources listed, but the state is now stored remotely in Azure Storage.

## State Locking with Azure Blob Storage

Azure Storage provides automatic state locking when using the `azurerm` backend. This prevents multiple users from running Terraform operations simultaneously, which could corrupt the state.

### How State Locking Works

1. **Acquisition**: Terraform acquires a lease on the state blob
2. **Operation**: Terraform performs the requested operation
3. **Release**: Terraform releases the lease when complete
4. **Conflict Prevention**: If another operation is in progress, Terraform waits or fails

### Testing State Locking

Let's test state locking behaviour:

```bash
# In one terminal, start a long-running operation
terraform plan

# In another terminal (different location), try another operation
terraform plan
```

The second operation will wait for the first to complete or will fail with a lock acquisition error.

### Force Unlock (Emergency Only)

If Terraform crashes and leaves a lock, you can force unlock:

```bash
# Only use in emergencies - can lead to state corruption
terraform force-unlock <lock-id>
```

**Warning**: Only use `force-unlock` when you're certain no other Terraform operations are running.

## Essential State Management Commands

Terraform provides several commands for inspecting and managing state:

### Listing Resources

```bash
# List all resources in state
terraform state list

# List resources with a filter
terraform state list "azurerm_resource_group.*"
```

### Inspecting Resources

```bash
# Show detailed information about a resource
terraform state show azurerm_resource_group.example

# Show all state information (large output)
terraform show
```

### Moving Resources

```bash
# Rename a resource in state (useful for refactoring)
terraform state mv azurerm_resource_group.example azurerm_resource_group.main
```

### Removing Resources

```bash
# Remove a resource from state (doesn't delete the actual resource)
terraform state rm azurerm_resource_group.example
```

### Importing Existing Resources

If you have existing Azure resources not managed by Terraform, you can import them:

```bash
# Import an existing resource group
terraform import azurerm_resource_group.existing /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}
```

### Backing Up State

```bash
# Create a backup of current state
terraform state pull > terraform.tfstate.backup
```

## Practical Example: Multi-Environment State Management

Let's create a more realistic example with separate state files for different environments:

### Environment-Specific Backend Configuration

Create separate backend configurations for each environment:

**environments/dev/main.tf**:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
  
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "terraform-backend-rg"
    storage_account_name = "tfstate<your-suffix>"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "dev/terraform.tfstate"  # Environment-specific key
  }
}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
  # subscription_id is required in provider 4.0+
  # Set via ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID environment variable
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "main" {
  name     = "myapp-dev-rg"
  location = "West Europe"
  
  tags = {
    Environment = "Development"
    ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
  }
}
```

**environments/prod/main.tf**:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
  
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "terraform-backend-rg"
    storage_account_name = "tfstate<your-suffix>"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "prod/terraform.tfstate"  # Environment-specific key
  }
}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
  # subscription_id is required in provider 4.0+
  # Set via ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID environment variable
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "main" {
  name     = "myapp-prod-rg"
  location = "West Europe"
  
  tags = {
    Environment = "Production"
    ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
  }
}
```

### Deploying Multiple Environments

```bash
# Deploy development environment
cd environments/dev
terraform init
terraform apply

# Deploy production environment
cd ../prod
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Each environment maintains its own state file in Azure Storage, preventing conflicts between environments.

## Team Collaboration Best Practices

### 1. Secure Backend Configuration Management

**Recommended Approach**: Keep sensitive backend configuration out of version control:

```text
# Project structure
terraform-project/
├── main.tf                    # Clean, no sensitive data
├── variables.tf
├── outputs.tf
├── .gitignore                 # Include backend configs
├── backend.hcl               # CI/CD backend config (gitignored)
└── override.tf               # Local dev config (gitignored)
```

**`.gitignore` entries**:

```gitignore
# Backend configuration files
backend.hcl
override.tf
*.auto.tfvars
.terraform/
terraform.tfstate*
```

**Team Workflow**:

- **Developers**: Use `override.tf` for local development
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Use `backend.hcl` or environment variables
- **Shared Code**: Keep `main.tf` clean with partial backend configuration

### 2. Environment-Specific Backend Strategies

#### Separate Backend Files per Environment

```bash
# Directory structure
environments/
├── dev/
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── backend-dev.hcl
├── staging/
│   ├── main.tf
│   └── backend-staging.hcl
└── prod/
    ├── main.tf
    └── backend-prod.hcl
```

#### Dynamic Backend Configuration in Pipelines

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Configure Backend
  run: |
    terraform init \
      -backend-config="key=${{ env.ENVIRONMENT }}/terraform.tfstate" \
      -backend-config="storage_account_name=${{ secrets.STORAGE_ACCOUNT }}"
```

### 3. Access Control

Implement proper access controls for your backend storage:

```bash
# Grant specific users access to the storage account
az role assignment create \
  --assignee user@company.com \
  --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/terraform-backend-rg/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storage-account-name}"
```

### 3. Authentication Methods

Configure authentication for team collaboration. **Note**: Azure RM provider 4.0+ requires subscription_id to be explicitly set.

**Option 1: Azure CLI (Development)**:

```bash
az login

# Provider 4.0+ requires explicit subscription configuration
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id --output tsv)
```

**Option 2: Service Principal (CI/CD - Legacy)**:

```bash
# Set environment variables - subscription_id is now mandatory
export ARM_CLIENT_ID="<service-principal-id>"
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="<service-principal-password>"
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<subscription-id>"
export ARM_TENANT_ID="<tenant-id>"
```

**Option 3: Federated Credentials (CI/CD - Recommended)**:

Modern CI/CD systems should use OpenID Connect (OIDC) federated credentials for secure, secret-free authentication:

```bash
# Set environment variables for federated auth
export ARM_CLIENT_ID="<service-principal-id>"
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<subscription-id>"
export ARM_TENANT_ID="<tenant-id>"
export ARM_USE_OIDC=true
# No ARM_CLIENT_SECRET needed!
```

**GitHub Actions Example**:

```yaml
- name: Azure Login
  uses: azure/login@v1
  with:
    client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
    tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
    subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}

- name: Terraform Apply
  run: terraform apply -auto-approve
  env:
    ARM_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
    ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
    ARM_TENANT_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
    ARM_USE_OIDC: true
```

**Azure DevOps Example**:

```yaml
- task: AzureCLI@2
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: 'your-service-connection'
    scriptType: 'bash'
    scriptLocation: 'inlineScript'
    inlineScript: |
      export ARM_CLIENT_ID=$(az account show --query user.name --output tsv)
      export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id --output tsv)
      export ARM_TENANT_ID=$(az account show --query tenantId --output tsv)
      export ARM_USE_OIDC=true
      terraform apply -auto-approve
```

**Option 4: Managed Identity (Azure VMs)**:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
  use_msi = true
  # subscription_id still required even with managed identity
  subscription_id = var.subscription_id  # Use variable, not hardcoded
}
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: State Lock Timeout

**Problem**: Terraform hangs waiting for state lock.

**Solution**:

```bash
# Check for stuck locks in Azure portal or CLI
az storage blob lease show \
  --account-name <storage-account> \
  --container-name tfstate \
  --name terraform.tfstate

# Force unlock if necessary (use with caution)
terraform force-unlock <lock-id>
```

### Issue 2: Authentication Errors

**Problem**: "Failed to get existing workspaces" or similar auth errors.

**Solution**:

```bash
# Re-authenticate with Azure
az login
az account show  # Verify correct subscription

# Or set environment variables for service principal
export ARM_CLIENT_ID="..."
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="..."
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="..."
export ARM_TENANT_ID="..."
```

**For Federated Credentials Issues**:

```bash
# Verify OIDC setup
export ARM_CLIENT_ID="..."
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="..."
export ARM_TENANT_ID="..."
export ARM_USE_OIDC=true

# Check if federated credential is properly configured in Azure AD
az ad sp federated-credential list --id $ARM_CLIENT_ID
```

### Issue 3: State File Corruption

**Problem**: State file becomes corrupted or inconsistent.

**Solution**:

```bash
# Restore from backup
terraform state pull > current-state-backup.json
# Manually restore from previous backup or fix issues
terraform state push fixed-state.json

# Or refresh state from actual infrastructure
terraform refresh
```

### Issue 4: Backend Migration Issues

**Problem**: Errors during backend migration.

**Solution**:

```bash
# Backup current state first
cp terraform.tfstate terraform.tfstate.backup

# Re-run migration with debugging
TF_LOG=DEBUG terraform init -migrate-state

# If migration fails, manually copy state
terraform state pull > local-backup.json
# Configure new backend
terraform init
terraform state push local-backup.json
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. State File Security

State files contain sensitive information:

- Resource configurations
- Output values (potentially secrets)
- Provider credentials
- Resource metadata

**Best Practices**:

- Enable encryption at rest for Azure Storage
- Use private storage containers
- Implement proper access controls
- Audit access to state files
- Never commit state files to version control

### 2. Backend Security Configuration

```hcl
# Secure backend configuration example
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "terraform-backend-rg"
    storage_account_name = "securebackendstore"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
    
    # Additional security options
    use_azuread_auth     = true  # Use Azure AD authentication
    use_msi              = true  # Use managed identity when available
  }
}
```

### 3. Secrets Management

Never store secrets in Terraform state or configuration:

```hcl
# BAD: Don't put secrets in configuration
resource "azurerm_key_vault_secret" "bad_example" {
  name         = "database-password"
  value        = "super-secret-password"  # This will be in state!
  key_vault_id = azurerm_key_vault.main.id
}

# GOOD: Use sensitive variables or external secret management
variable "database_password" {
  description = "Database password"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}

resource "azurerm_key_vault_secret" "good_example" {
  name         = "database-password"
  value        = var.database_password
  key_vault_id = azurerm_key_vault.main.id
}
```

## Best Practices Summary
