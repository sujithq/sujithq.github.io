## 🏎️ Prioritizing speed

### o4-mini — The speed specialist ⚡  

✅ **Best for**:

- Rapid prototyping  
- Small code snippet explanations  
- Utility functions and boilerplate generation  

👀 **Consider other models if**: You need multi-file reasoning — **GPT-5** or **Claude Sonnet 4** will serve you better.

---

### Gemini 2.0 Flash — The visual sprinter 🎯  

✅ **Best for**:

- Analyzing diagrams or UI layouts quickly  
- Real-time design feedback  
- Short, multimodal tasks  

👀 **Consider other models if**: You need longer context or deeper reasoning — **Gemini 2.5 Pro** or **GPT-5** are better choices.

---

## ⚖️ Balanced AI models

### GPT-4.1 — The reliable all-rounder 🌍  

✅ **Best for**:

- General-purpose coding and writing  
- Multilingual and multimodal workflows  
- Accurate, predictable completions  

👀 **Consider other models if**: You want the latest reasoning improvements — **GPT-5** offers more depth.

---

### Claude Sonnet 3.7 — The structured coder ✍️  

✅ **Best for**:

- Well-formatted, consistent output  
- Documentation and code comments  
- Large but not overly complex projects  

👀 **Consider other models if**: You need high-pressure reasoning — **Claude Sonnet 4** or **GPT-5** are stronger.

---

## 🧠 Models for complex projects

### GPT-5 — The next-gen problem solver 🏆  

✅ **Best for**:

- Multi-file reasoning and debugging  
- Large refactors and architecture planning  
- Reducing hallucinations in complex tasks  

👀 **Consider other models if**: Budget is tight — **Claude Sonnet 4** or **o3** may be cheaper alternatives.

---

### Claude Sonnet 4 — The balanced strategist 🏠  

✅ **Best for**:

- Complex workflows with high reliability  
- Balancing speed and reasoning depth  
- Coding under pressure  

👀 **Consider other models if**: You need extreme

## 🖼️ Working with visuals (text + images)

Some Copilot models can work with both code and visuals — for example, diagrams, screenshots, or UI mockups.  
This can be useful for debugging layouts, interpreting architecture diagrams, or generating code based on design references.

### GPT-5 — The unified visual + reasoning model 🎨  

✅ **Best for**:

- Combining diagram analysis with code context  
- Visual-assisted debugging and planning  

👀 **Consider other models if**: You only need pure text/code completion — **GPT-4.1** or **o4-mini** may be faster.

---

### GPT-4.1 — The dependable visualist 👁️  

✅ **Best for**:

- Code + diagram combined workflows  
- Multilingual documentation with visual references  

👀 **Consider other models if**: You need deeper reasoning — **GPT-5** offers more advanced problem solving.

---

### Claude Opus 4 — The visual architect 🏛️  

✅ **Best for**:

- Debugging complex UI layouts  
- Reviewing and refining design prototypes  

👀 **Consider other models if**: Cost is a concern — **Claude Sonnet 4** can be more budget-friendly.

---

### Claude Sonnet 4 — The balanced visual coder 📐  

✅ **Best for**:

- Day-to-day coding with occasional visual analysis  
- Merging visual and textual reasoning without big performance hits  

👀 **Consider other models if**: Your visuals require deep, long-context reasoning — **Claude Opus 4** or **GPT-5** may be better.

---

### Gemini 2.0 Flash — The instant visual helper ⚡  

✅ **Best for**:

- Real-time UI feedback  
- Diagram-based code generation  
- Rapid layout debugging  

👀 **Consider other models if**: You need detailed, research-level analysis — **Gemini 2.5 Pro** or **GPT-5** are stronger.

---
