## 🏎️ Prioritizing speed

### GPT-5 mini — The speed specialist ⚡

If you need quick results without overcomplicating things, GPT-5 mini is fast, efficient, and cost-effective.

✅ **Best for**:

- Rapid prototyping
- Small code snippet explanations
- Learning new programming concepts
- Boilerplate generation

👀 **Consider other models if**:  
Your task involves multiple files or deep reasoning. For that, try **GPT-5 Thinking**, **Claude Sonnet 4**, or **Claude Opus 4**.

### o4-mini (Legacy) — The former speed option 😈

Still fast and cost-effective, but now largely replaced by GPT-5 mini in Copilot and ChatGPT.  
Consider it if you have existing workflows optimised for o4-mini or if GPT-5 mini isn’t available in your tier.

✅ **Best for**:

- Rapid prototyping.
- Explaining small code snippets.
- Learning new programming concepts.
- Generating boilerplate code.

👀 **Consider other models if**: Your task involves multiple files or requires deep reasoning. In such cases, **Claude Sonnet 4**, **Claude Opus 4**, or **o3** are better suited. For more expressive outputs, **GPT-4.1** is still a relevant alternative.

## ⚖️ Balanced AI models

### Claude 3.5 Sonnet — The reliable all-rounder 😊

Balances performance and cost, making it dependable for daily coding.

✅ **Best for**:

- Documentation
- Language-specific Q&A
- Concise code generation

👀 **Consider other models if**: You need multi-step planning — **Claude Sonnet 4** or **GPT-5 Thinking** may work better.

### GPT-4.1 — The versatile performer 🌎

GPT-4.1 is highly flexible and can handle a wide range of tasks. Whether you need quick responses or support for text and images, it’s got you covered.

Still relevant in August 2025, especially when you need multimodal support and predictable output.

✅ **Best for**:

- Code explanations
- Writing comments/documentation
- Multilingual prompts
- Text + image workflows

## 🧠 Models for complex projects

### GPT-5 Thinking / GPT-5 Pro — The next-gen problem solvers 🏆

GPT-5 variants designed for advanced reasoning, fewer hallucinations, and complex debugging.

✅ **Best for**:

- Refactoring large codebases
- Multi-file reasoning
- Complex architectural planning
- Data analysis

👀 **Consider other models if**:  
Budget is tight — **GPT-5 mini** or **Claude Sonnet 4** can be cheaper alternatives.

### Claude Sonnet 4: The problem solver 🏠

Claude Sonnet 4 is designed for large, intricate projects. It excels in tasks that require deep context and detailed analysis, and is the successor to Claude 3.7 Sonnet.

✅ **Best for**:

- Refactoring large codebases.
- Planning complex system architectures.
- Designing algorithms.
- Combining high-level summaries with in-depth analysis.

👀 **Consider other models if**: You’re working on simpler tasks or need faster iterations. **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** or **o4-mini** might be more efficient.

### Claude Opus 4: The advanced problem solver 🏆

Anthropic’s most powerful model for multi-layered logic and long-context reasoning.

✅ **Best for**:

- Writing full functions, classes, or multi-file logic.
- Debugging complex systems.
- Planning and analyzing complex architectures.
- Processing extensive datasets or documents.

👀 **Consider other models if**: Budget is a concern. For cost-effective alternatives, try **Claude Sonnet 4** or **GPT-5 mini**.

### Gemini 2.5 Pro: The advanced researcher 🔬

Ideal for advanced reasoning, long-context analysis, and research workflows.

✅ **Best for**:

- Writing full functions, classes, or multi-file logic.
- Debugging complex systems.
- Analyzing scientific data and generating insights.
- Processing extensive datasets or documents.

👀 **Consider other models if**: Budget is a concern. For cost-effective alternatives, try **o4-mini** or **Gemini 2.0 Flash**.

### o3: The precision expert 🥽

For tasks that require logical precision and step-by-step problem-solving, o3 is excellent.

✅ **Best for**:

- Optimizing performance-critical code.
- Debugging complex systems.
- Writing structured, reusable code.
- Summarizing logs or benchmarks.

👀 **Consider other models if**: You’re in the early stages of prototyping or need something lightweight. **o4-mini** or **GPT-4.1** might be better suited.

## 🖼️ Multimodal capabilities

### GPT-5 — Unified multimodal model 🎨

Supports text, images, and advanced reasoning in one.  
Great for coding tasks that require diagram analysis or combining visual and text-based input.

### Gemini 2.0 Flash: The visual problem-solver 🤔

If your work involves visual inputs like diagrams or UI mockups, Gemini 2.0 Flash is a great choice. It’s particularly useful for front-end development and layout debugging.

✅ **Best for**:

- Analyzing diagrams or screenshots.
- Debugging UI layouts.
- Generating code snippets.
- Providing design feedback.

👀 **Consider other models if**: Your task requires detailed algorithmic reasoning. **Claude Opus 4** or **Gemini 2.5 Pro** are better equipped for such challenges.

## Final thoughts

The AI landscape shifts quickly.  
As of **August 2025**, **GPT-5** is the go-to choice for most GitHub Copilot users — fast, accurate, and now the default in ChatGPT.  
It offers better reasoning, fewer hallucinations, personalization features, and deeper multimodal capabilities.  

That said, models like Claude Sonnet 4, Claude Opus 4, and Gemini 2.x still shine in certain niches.  
Legacy options like o4-mini can still be useful for very lightweight tasks or legacy setups.

Experimentation is still the best way to refine your workflow — the “right” model depends on your exact coding needs and subscription tier.
