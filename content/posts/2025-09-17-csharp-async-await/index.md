Asynchronous programming is one of the most powerful features in modern C#. It keeps your applications **responsive, scalable, and efficient** â€” but it can also be tricky to master.  

This 7-part series takes you from the basics of `async`/`await` to advanced scenarios, pitfalls, and testing strategies. Each part builds on the previous one with **clear explanations and practical code samples**.

## ðŸ“š Table of Contents

### **Part 1: Introduction to Asynchronous Programming**

Why async matters, the difference between blocking and non-blocking code, and your first `async/await` example.  
ðŸ‘‰ [Read Part 1](./part1.md)

### **Part 2: Deep Dive into `async` and `await`**

The anatomy of an async method, return types (`Task`, `Task<T>`, `void`), and how `await` really works.  
ðŸ‘‰ Releases 24 Sep 2025

### **Part 3: Common Pitfalls & Best Practices**

Avoiding `async void`, handling deadlocks, using `ConfigureAwait(false)`, and safe exception handling.  
ðŸ‘‰ Releases 01 Oct 2025

### **Part 4: Patterns with Async**

Running multiple tasks in parallel, cancelling with `CancellationToken`, using async streams, and implementing timeouts/retries.  
ðŸ‘‰ Releases 08 Oct 2025

### **Part 5: Real-World Use Cases**

How async improves real apps: calling APIs with `HttpClient`, async file I/O, EF Core queries, responsive UIs, and background services.  
ðŸ‘‰ Releases 15 Oct 2025

### **Part 6: Advanced Topics**

Performance with `ValueTask`, writing custom awaiters, using coordination primitives (`SemaphoreSlim`, `Channel`), and tuning async performance.  
ðŸ‘‰ Releases 22 Oct 2025

### **Part 7: Testing and Debugging Async Code**

Writing async unit tests, mocking async methods, debugging with Visual Studio async tools, logging async flows, and handling unobserved exceptions.  
ðŸ‘‰ Releases 29 Oct 2025
