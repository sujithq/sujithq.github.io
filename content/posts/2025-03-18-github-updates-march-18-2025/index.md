Whether itâ€™s **security and compliance advancements**, **performance optimizations**, or **new tools for automation and insights**, this changelog keeps you informed about whatâ€™s new and how it can benefit your workflow.  

Inspired by our [previous release](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-02-05-view-and-iterate-on-generated-files-directly-within-copilot-chat-preview/), working with [Copilot Chat](https://github.com/copilot) on GitHub has become even more seamless. You can instantly preview HTML files, edit files youâ€™ve created, and work on issues right away. Several exciting new capabilities give you more control and flexibility.

### Whatâ€™s new

- Edit files in the side panel to seamlessly refine and adjust them
- Generate and preview Mermaid diagrams for fast visualizations, whether theyâ€™re flowcharts or sequence diagrams
- Keep tabs on your issues in the same right side panel, ensuring you can tackle open tasks while discussing them
- Track issues or pull requests in responses that are rendered in a familiar GitHub style, making working with them easier
- In addition, you can enjoy a smoother streaming experience and enhanced rendering of attachments.
