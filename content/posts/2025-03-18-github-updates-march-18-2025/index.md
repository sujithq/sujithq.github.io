## **Introduction: GitHub Changelog – Latest Updates & Enhancements**  

Stay up to date with the latest **GitHub updates, features, and improvements** designed to enhance your development experience. Whether it’s **security and compliance advancements**, **performance optimizations**, or **new tools for automation and insights**, this changelog keeps you informed about what’s new and how it can benefit your workflow.  

Inspired by our [previous release](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-02-05-view-and-iterate-on-generated-files-directly-within-copilot-chat-preview/), working with [Copilot Chat](https://github.com/copilot) on GitHub has become even more seamless. You can instantly preview HTML files, edit files you’ve created, and work on issues right away. Several exciting new capabilities give you more control and flexibility.

### What’s new

- Preview your rendered HTML files directly in the side panel
- Edit files in the side panel to seamlessly refine and adjust them
- Generate and preview Mermaid diagrams for fast visualizations, whether they’re flowcharts or sequence diagrams
- Keep tabs on your issues in the same right side panel, ensuring you can tackle open tasks while discussing them
- Track issues or pull requests in responses that are rendered in a familiar GitHub style, making working with them easier
- In addition, you can enjoy a smoother streaming experience and enhanced rendering of attachments.
