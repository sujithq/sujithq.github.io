## Mastering Platform Engineering: From Golden Paths to Selling Your MVP

Platform engineering is no longer a buzzword: it‚Äôs a proven practice that bridges the gap between developers and operations by building Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs). As [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/what-is-platform-engineering) predicts, by 2026, 80% of large software engineering organisations will establish platform engineering teams as internal providers of reusable services, components, and tools for application delivery.

The **Platform Engineering Certified Practitioner** course equips engineers, architects, and technology leaders with the knowledge and hands-on frameworks to design, build, and scale successful platforms inside their organisations.

## Why This Course Matters

Modern DevOps setups often struggle with:

- High cognitive load for developers  
- Long waiting times for infrastructure  
- Low productivity and shadow operations  
- Lack of standardisation and automation  

Platform engineering addresses these pain points by creating **golden paths**, standardising infrastructure, and enabling self-service, while treating the platform as a **product** ([CNCF Maturity Model](https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/whitepapers/platform-eng-maturity-model/)).

By the end of the course, you‚Äôll be able to:

- Build an Internal Developer Platform from scratch  
- Apply best practices such as abstraction layers, golden paths, and everything-as-code  
- Launch a Minimum Viable Platform (MVP) in weeks, not years  
- Secure buy-in from executives and stakeholders by selling your MVP  

## Inside the Course: Module Highlights

### 1. Introduction to Platform Engineering

Understand the evolution from DevOps to platform engineering, the importance of treating platforms as products, and how IDPs enable ‚Äútrue DevOps‚Äù.

### 2. Building an Internal Developer Platform

Explore platform team composition, maturity models, and reference architectures for multi-cloud environments. Learn why platforms should start from the backend, not the portal.

### 3. Platform Tooling 101

Dive into the **five planes of platform architecture**: developer control, integration and delivery, resource, monitoring and logging, and security. Get hands-on with frameworks such as CNOE and Pocket IDP.

### 4. The Art of Building Golden Paths

Learn how to design end-to-end developer workflows that reduce cognitive load, waiting times, and ticket operations. Golden paths automate manual tasks and embed security by design.

### 5. Finding the Right Abstractions

Discover how frontend (portals, declarative configs) and backend (orchestrators, infrastructure as code) abstractions balance usability with flexibility. Avoid golden cages by shielding complexity without removing context.

### 6. Infrastructure Platform Engineering

Deep dive into infrastructure orchestration, vending machine-style provisioning, and applying ‚Äúeverything as code‚Äù for scalable platforms.

### 7. How to Build Your Minimum Viable Platform (MVP)

Practical framework for building an MVP in **8 weeks**. Learn to measure onboarding time, service creation time, and complexity reduction as success metrics.

### 8. How to Sell Your MVP to Stakeholders

Winning stakeholder buy-in is crucial. This module shows how to frame value for:  

- Developers: self-service, golden paths  
- I&O teams: standardisation, cost reduction  
- Security: guardrails, automation  
- Executives: ROI, business case  

## Who Should Take This Course?

- **Platform Engineers**: Build advanced knowledge and frameworks to succeed in your role.  
- **DevOps & SREs**: Learn how to evolve from fragmented toolchains to structured platforms.  
- **Engineering Leaders & Architects**: Understand how to fund, scale, and secure stakeholder buy-in for your platform initiative.  

## Certification and Beyond

The course concludes with a **certification exam** (60 minutes, multiple choice, two attempts). Passing it validates you as a **Platform Engineering Certified Practitioner**: a credential increasingly in demand as organisations scale their digital capabilities.

Graduates are also invited to join the community, attend **PlatformCon**, and continue their journey into the **Certified Professional** track.

## Recap and Next Steps

The **Platform Engineering Certified Practitioner** course is more than theory: it‚Äôs a **playbook for real-world platform success**. Whether you‚Äôre just starting with platform engineering or looking to scale your MVP into a production-ready platform, this programme will give you the tools, frameworks, and credibility to make it happen.
