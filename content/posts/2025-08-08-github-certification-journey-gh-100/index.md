Implement comprehensive GitHub Actions administration with self-hosted runners and enterprise policies.

**Objectives:**

- Set up enterprise GitHub Actions policies
- Deploy and manage self-hosted runner infrastructure

**Self-Hosted Runner Deployment:**

```yaml
# Docker Compose for self-hosted runners
version: '3.8'

services:
  github-runner-1:
    image: myoung34/github-runner:latest
    environment:
      - ORG_NAME=your-org
      - ACCESS_TOKEN=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
      - RUNNER_NAME=enterprise-runner-1
      - RUNNER_WORKDIR=/tmp/runner/work
      - LABELS=self-hosted,production,linux,x64
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - /tmp/runner:/tmp/runner
    restart: unless-stopped
    
  github-runner-2:
    image: myoung34/github-runner:latest
    environment:
      - ORG_NAME=your-org
      - ACCESS_TOKEN=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
      - RUNNER_NAME=enterprise-runner-2
      - RUNNER_WORKDIR=/tmp/runner/work
      - LABELS=self-hosted,production,linux,x64
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - /tmp/runner:/tmp/runner
    restart: unless-stopped
```

**Actions Administration Scripts:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# GitHub Actions enterprise administration

ORG="your-org"
TOKEN="your-token"

# Create runner group
gh api /orgs/$ORG/actions/runner-groups \
  --method POST \
  --field name="production-runners" \
  --field visibility="selected" \
  --field selected_repository_ids:='[123, 456]'

# List runner groups
gh api /orgs/$ORG/actions/runner-groups \
  --jq '.runner_groups[] | {id: .id, name: .name, visibility: .visibility}'

# Get Actions usage statistics
gh api /orgs/$ORG/actions/billing/usage \
  --jq '{total_minutes_used: .total_minutes_used, total_paid_minutes_used: .total_paid_minutes_used}'
```

## Enterprise Administration Best Practices

### Governance Framework

**1. Administrative Hierarchy:**

```yaml
# Enterprise governance structure
governance_hierarchy:
  enterprise_administrators:
    responsibilities:
      - Enterprise billing and licensing
      - Organisation creation and management
      - Enterprise-wide policy enforcement
      - Compliance and audit oversight
      
  organisation_owners:
    responsibilities:
      - Organisation security policies
      - Team and repository management
      - User access control
      - Organisation billing oversight
      
  team_maintainers:
    responsibilities:
      - Team membership management
      - Repository access control
      - Team-specific policies
      - Developer onboarding
```

**2. Access Control Framework:**

```yaml
# Role-based access control matrix
rbac_matrix:
  repository_permissions:
    read: ["all_members"]
    write: ["team_members", "collaborators"]
    admin: ["team_maintainers", "org_owners"]
    
  organisation_permissions:
    member: ["basic_access"]
    moderator: ["issue_management"]
    billing_manager: ["billing_access"]
    owner: ["full_access"]
    
  enterprise_permissions:
    member: ["org_access"]
    billing_manager: ["enterprise_billing"]
    owner: ["enterprise_admin"]
```

### Operational Excellence

**Monitoring and Alerting:**

```python
# Enterprise monitoring and alerting system
class GitHubEnterpriseMonitor:
    def __init__(self, enterprise, token):
        self.enterprise = enterprise
        self.client = GitHubClient(token)
        
    def monitor_user_activity(self):
        """Monitor user login and activity patterns"""
        audit_events = self.client.get_audit_events(
            phrase='action:oauth_access_token'
        )
        
        activity_metrics = {
            'total_logins': len(audit_events),
            'unique_users': len(set(event['actor'] for event in audit_events)),
            'failed_attempts': len([e for e in audit_events if e.get('failure')])
        }
        
        return activity_metrics
    
    def monitor_security_compliance(self):
        """Monitor security compliance across organisations"""
        orgs = self.client.get_enterprise_orgs()
        compliance_summary = {}
        
        for org in orgs:
            compliance_summary[org['login']] = {
                'saml_enabled': org.get('saml_enabled', False),
                '2fa_required': org.get('two_factor_requirement_enabled', False),
                'private_repos': org.get('private_repos', 0),
                'total_repos': org.get('total_private_repos', 0)
            }
        
        return compliance_summary
```

### Cost Optimisation Strategies

**License Management:**

```python
# GitHub license optimisation
class GitHubLicenseOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, enterprise, token):
        self.enterprise = enterprise
        self.client = GitHubClient(token)
