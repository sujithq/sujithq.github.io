+++

Keeping your GitHub repositories clean is crucial for maintainability. Over time, branches pile up, making it difficult to track whatâ€™s relevant. If youâ€™re managing multiple repositories in an organization, manually identifying stale branches can be a hassle.  

Luckily, with the **GitHub CLI (`gh`)**, you can automate this process and generate a **report of all non-main branches along with their last authors**.  

This guide walks you through a **Bash script** that:  
âœ… Retrieves all repositories in an organization  
âœ… Lists branches, excluding `main`, `master`, and `azure-master`  
âœ… Identifies the last commit author for each branch  
âœ… Groups the results by author for better visibility  

---

## ðŸ”§ Prerequisites  

Before running the script, make sure:  

- You have **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`).  
- You have **appropriate permissions** to list repositories and fetch branch details in your organization.  
- You're running a **Unix-based system** (Linux/macOS or WSL for Windows).  

---

## ðŸ“œ The Script  

Hereâ€™s the complete Bash script to **scan all repositories** in your GitHub organization and generate a **stale branch report**:  

```bash
# Set Variables
org="<Replace with your GitHub Organization name>"
raw_output_file="branches.txt"
report_file="report.txt"

# Clear previous output
> "$raw_output_file"

# Get the repositories as JSON and extract names
repos=$(gh repo list "$org" --json name --jq '.[].name')

# Function to get branch author safely
get_author() {
    local org=$1
    local repo=$2
    local branch=$3
    local author

    # Try fetching author name
    author=$(gh api "/repos/$org/$repo/branches/$branch" --jq '.commit.commit.author.name' 2>/dev/null)

    # If author is empty, return "Unknown"
    if [[ -z "$author" ]]; then
        author="Unknown"
    fi

    # Write to output file
    echo "  - Author: $author" >> "$raw_output_file"
}

# Loop through each repository
for repo in $repos; do
    echo "- repo: $repo" >> "$raw_output_file"
    
    # Get all branches in the repository
    branches=$(gh api "/repos/$org/$repo/branches" --jq '.[].name')

    # Loop through each branch
    for branch in $branches; do
        # Skip master, azure-master, and main
        if [[ "$branch" == "master" || "$branch" == "azure-master" || "$branch" == "main" ]]; then
            continue
        fi

        echo " - Branch: $branch" >> "$raw_output_file"
        # Fetch branch author
        get_author "$org" "$repo" "$branch"
    done
done

declare -A author_repos  # Declare an associative array

# Ensure the array is cleared before each run
unset author_repos
declare -A author_repos

# Clear previous report
> "$report_file"

# Read and process output file
while IFS= read -r line; do
    if [[ $line == "- repo: "* ]]; then
        repo=$(echo "$line" | awk '{print $3}')
    elif [[ $line == " - Branch: "* ]]; then
        branch=$(echo "$line" | awk '{print $3}')
    elif [[ $line == "  - Author: "* ]]; then
        author=$(echo "$line" | sed 's/  - Author: //')  # Extract author name

        # Store branch under author
        author_repos["$author"]+=$'\n'"- $repo -> $branch"
    fi
done < "$raw_output_file"

# Print grouped results
for author in "${!author_repos[@]}"; do
    echo "Author: $author" >> "$report_file"
    echo "${author_repos[$author]}" >> "$report_file"
    echo >> "$report_file"
done

cat "$report_file"
```

---

## ðŸ“Š Example Output  

Once executed, the script produces a **report grouped by author**, making it easy to find out **who owns stale branches**:

```text
Author: Alice
- repo1 -> feature/login-page
- repo2 -> hotfix/payment-fix

Author: Bob
- repo3 -> refactor/api-updates
- repo1 -> test/legacy-integration

Author: Unknown
- repo4 -> bugfix/session-timeout
```

---

## ðŸ”¥ Why This Matters  

1. **Easier Maintenance** â€“ Identify branches that can be deleted or merged.  
2. **Better Collaboration** â€“ Reach out to authors to confirm branch status.  
3. **Improved Performance** â€“ Reducing unnecessary branches speeds up repository operations.  

You can extend this script further to:  
âœ… Filter branches by **last commit date**  
âœ… Automatically **delete stale branches** (with `gh api -X DELETE`)  
âœ… Generate a **GitHub issue or PR** listing stale branches  

Would love to hear how you customize this for your workflow! ðŸš€
