ORG="your-organisation"
TOKEN="your-github-token"

# Get all repositories
repos=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: token $TOKEN" \
  "https://api.github.com/orgs/$ORG/repos?per_page=100" | \
  jq -r '.[].name')

# Enable secret scanning for each repository
for repo in $repos; do
  echo "Enabling secret scanning for $repo"
  curl -X PATCH \
    -H "Authorization: token $TOKEN" \
    -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
    "https://api.github.com/repos/$ORG/$repo" \
    -d '{

        "secret_scanning": {"status": "enabled"},
        "secret_scanning_push_protection": {"status": "enabled"}
      }
    }'
done
```

1. **Custom Secret Pattern Configuration:**

```json
{
  "name": "Internal API Key Pattern",
  "description": "Detects internal API keys for proprietary systems",
  "secret_type": "internal_api_key",
  "regex": "(?i)internal[_-]?api[_-]?key[\"']?\\s*[:=]\\s*[\"']?([a-z0-9]{40})[\"']?",
  "test_cases": [
    {
      "text": "internal_api_key = \"a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcd\"",

 * @precision medium
 * @id custom/hardcoded-api-endpoints
 * @tags security
 *       external/cwe/cwe-200
 */

import javascript

from StringLiteral str
where str.getValue().regexpMatch("https?://[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.(internal|corp|local)/.*")
   or str.getValue().regexpMatch("https?://.*(api|service)\\.(internal|corp|local).*")
select str, "Hardcoded internal API endpoint found: " + str.getValue()
```

**CodeQL Configuration File:**

```yaml
# .github/codeql/codeql-config.yml
name: "Custom CodeQL Configuration"

queries:
  - uses: security-extended
  - uses: ./.github/codeql/custom-queries/

paths-ignore:
  - "test/**"
  - "docs/**"
  - "**/*.md"

paths:
  - "src/**"
  - "lib/**"
```

## Enterprise Security Best Practices

### Security Policy Framework

**1. Repository Security Standards:**

```yaml
# Security policy template
security_requirements:
  code_scanning:
    required: true
    tools: ["CodeQL", "SonarCloud"]
    frequency: "on_push"
    
  secret_scanning:
    enabled: true
    push_protection: true
    custom_patterns: true
    
  dependency_scanning:
    dependabot_enabled: true
    security_updates: true
    vulnerability_threshold: "high"
    
  branch_protection:
    required_reviews: 2
    dismiss_stale_reviews: true
    require_code_owner_reviews: true
    required_status_checks:
      - "CodeQL"
      - "Dependency Review"
```

**2. Incident Response Procedures:**

```yaml
# Security incident response workflow
incident_response:
  critical_vulnerabilities:
    response_time: "2 hours"
    escalation: ["security-team", "platform-team"]
    actions:
      - immediate_assessment
      - impact_analysis
      - remediation_planning
      - stakeholder_notification
      
  secret_exposure:
    response_time: "30 minutes"
    actions:
      - revoke_exposed_secrets
      - assess_potential_impact
      - implement_new_credentials
      - audit_access_logs
```

### Compliance and Audit Framework

**Security Metrics Dashboard:**

```python
# Security compliance reporting
class SecurityComplianceReporter:
    def __init__(self, github_client):
        self.client = github_client
        
    def generate_compliance_report(self, org):
        report = {
            'timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            'organisation': org,
            'metrics': {}
        }
        
        # GHAS adoption metrics
        repos = self.client.get_org_repos(org)
        total_repos = len(repos)
        ghas_enabled = sum(1 for r in repos if r.advanced_security_enabled)
        
        report['metrics']['ghas_adoption'] = {
            'total_repositories': total_repos,
            'ghas_enabled': ghas_enabled,
            'adoption_percentage': (ghas_enabled / total_repos) * 100
        }
        
        # Vulnerability metrics
        vulnerabilities = self.get_vulnerability_summary(org)
        report['metrics']['vulnerabilities'] = vulnerabilities
        
        return report
```
