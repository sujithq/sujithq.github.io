## Part 6: Advanced Topics

Now that weâ€™ve mastered the basics and patterns, letâ€™s go further into **advanced async scenarios** youâ€™ll meet when optimizing throughput or designing libraries.

---

## `ValueTask` vs `Task`

`Task` is a reference type allocated on the heap. In ultraâ€‘hot paths where many calls **complete synchronously**, `ValueTask` can save allocations.

```csharp
public async ValueTask<int> GetNumberAsync(bool cached)
{
    if (cached) return 42;        // completes synchronously (no allocation)
    await Task.Delay(1000);       // completes asynchronously
    return 42;
}
```

**Guidelines**  

- Prefer `Task` by default (simpler, safer).  
- Consider `ValueTask` when profiling shows allocation pressure and many sync completions.  
- Donâ€™t await a `ValueTask` more than once and donâ€™t store it; convert to `Task` via `.AsTask()` if you must pass it around.

---

## Custom Awaiters (rare, but educational)

Anything with a `GetAwaiter()` that returns an awaiter implementing `INotifyCompletion` (or `ICriticalNotifyCompletion`) is awaitable.

```csharp
public sealed class DelayAwaitable
{
    private readonly int _ms;
    public DelayAwaitable(int ms) => _ms = ms;
    public TaskAwaiter GetAwaiter() => Task.Delay(_ms).GetAwaiter();
}

// usage
await new DelayAwaitable(250);
Console.WriteLine("custom awaiter resumed");
```

**When would you do this?**  

- Domainâ€‘specific scheduling/timing semantics.  
- Interop layers.  
Most apps never need it; understanding it helps you reason about `await`.

---

## Async Coordination Primitives

### Limit concurrency with `SemaphoreSlim`

```csharp
var gate = new SemaphoreSlim(3); // allow 3 concurrent ops

async Task ProcessAsync(string item)
{
    await gate.WaitAsync();
    try
    {
        await DoWorkAsync(item);
    }
    finally
    {
        gate.Release();
    }
}
```

Use this to throttle IOâ€‘heavy fanâ€‘out work (APIs, disk, DB) and avoid overloading dependencies.

### Pipelines with `Channel<T>`

`System.Threading.Channels` enables highâ€‘throughput producer/consumer pipelines.

```csharp
var channel = Channel.CreateUnbounded<string>();

// producer
_ = Task.Run(async () =>
{
    foreach (var url in urls)
        await channel.Writer.WriteAsync(url);
    channel.Writer.Complete();
});

// consumer(s)
await foreach (var url in channel.Reader.ReadAllAsync())
{
    var html = await client.GetStringAsync(url);
    Console.WriteLine($"{url} -> {html.Length} bytes");
}
```

Channels support backpressure (bounded channels), multiple consumers, and graceful completion.

## Performance Tuning Checklist

- **Avoid unnecessary `Task.Run`** in ASP.NET Core â€” IO work should be awaited; `Task.Run` is for CPUâ€‘bound work that you explicitly want off the request thread.  
- **Batch awaits** with `Task.WhenAll` to reduce continuation overhead when independent operations can run together.  
- **Use `ConfigureAwait(false)`** in libraries/background services to skip context capture. (In ASP.NET Core thereâ€™s no synchronization context, but it still avoids overhead.)  
- **Minimize layers** of trivial `async` wrappers; if you just return a task, you may not need `async/await` at that layer.  
- **Pool and reuse** expensive objects correctly (e.g., reuse `HttpClient` via `IHttpClientFactory`).  
- **Measure first** with a profiler (allocs, context switches, contention) before microâ€‘optimizing.

---

## Debuggable, Defensive Async

- Prefer **cancellable** APIs: accept a `CancellationToken`.  
- Use **timeouts** where appropriate to avoid stuck requests.  
- Add **structured logging** around awaits (operation name, correlation IDs).  
- In fireâ€‘andâ€‘forget scenarios, capture and log exceptions inside the launched task.

---

## Key Takeaways

- `ValueTask` can reduce allocations in hot paths; default to `Task` otherwise.  
- Custom awaiters are a niche but deepen understanding of `await`.  
- `SemaphoreSlim` and `Channel<T>` are your goâ€‘to tools for concurrency control and pipelines.  
- Tune with evidence: profile, batch awaits, and avoid unnecessary context capture.

ðŸ‘‰ In **Part 7**, weâ€™ll wrap up with **testing and debugging async code**: async unit tests, mocking, Visual Studioâ€™s async tools, and tracing async flows.
