## Part 4: Patterns with Async

So far, weâ€™ve looked at the basics and pitfalls of `async`/`await`. Now letâ€™s move to **patterns** that help you handle real-world scenarios like parallelism, cancellation, streaming, and timeouts.

---

## Pattern 1: Running Tasks in Parallel

Sometimes you want to start multiple operations and wait for all of them.

```csharp
public async Task FetchInParallelAsync()
{
    var client = new HttpClient();

    var task1 = client.GetStringAsync("https://example.com/page1");
    var task2 = client.GetStringAsync("https://example.com/page2");

    var results = await Task.WhenAll(task1, task2);

    Console.WriteLine($"Page1 length: {results[0].Length}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Page2 length: {results[1].Length}");
}
```

âœ… **Use `Task.WhenAll`** when you need *all* tasks to finish.  
âœ… **Use `Task.WhenAny`** when you only care about the first result:

```csharp
var firstFinished = await Task.WhenAny(task1, task2);
Console.WriteLine(await firstFinished);
```

---

## Pattern 2: Cancelling Tasks

Long-running operations should be cancellable. Enter `CancellationToken`.

```csharp
public async Task DoWorkAsync(CancellationToken token)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
        Console.WriteLine($"Step {i}");
        await Task.Delay(500, token);
    }
}
```

Usage:

```csharp
var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
var task = DoWorkAsync(cts.Token);

// Cancel after 2 seconds
cts.CancelAfter(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2));

try
{
    await task;
}
catch (OperationCanceledException)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Task was cancelled.");
}
```

---

## Pattern 3: Async Streams

Introduced in C# 8, `IAsyncEnumerable<T>` lets you stream data asynchronously.

```csharp
public async IAsyncEnumerable<int> GetNumbersAsync()
{
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
    {
        await Task.Delay(500); // simulate delay
        yield return i;
    }
}
```

Usage:

```csharp
await foreach (var number in GetNumbersAsync())
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
}
```

This is great for processing **large data sets** or **network streams** without loading everything into memory.

---

## Pattern 4: Timeouts with `Task.Delay`

---

You can combine `Task.Delay` with `Task.WhenAny` to implement timeouts:

```csharp
public async Task<string> FetchWithTimeoutAsync(string url, int timeoutMs)
{
    var client = new HttpClient();
    var fetchTask = client.GetStringAsync(url);
    var timeoutTask = Task.Delay(timeoutMs);

    var finished = await Task.WhenAny(fetchTask, timeoutTask);

    if (finished == timeoutTask)
        throw new TimeoutException("The request timed out");

    return await fetchTask; // Safe to await now
}
```

---

## Bonus: Retry Pattern

Transient failures (like network hiccups) are common. A simple retry looks like this:

```csharp
public async Task<T> RetryAsync<T>(Func<Task<T>> operation, int maxRetries = 3)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++)
    {
        try
        {
            return await operation();
        }
        catch when (i < maxRetries - 1)
        {
            await Task.Delay(500); // backoff
        }
    }
    throw new Exception("Operation failed after retries.");
}
```

---

## Key Takeaways

- Use `Task.WhenAll`/`Task.WhenAny` for parallelism.  
- Always provide cancellation with `CancellationToken`.  
- Use `IAsyncEnumerable<T>` for streaming async data.  
- Combine `Task.Delay` with `Task.WhenAny` for timeouts.  
- Add retries for resilient systems.

ðŸ‘‰ In **Part 5**, weâ€™ll look at **real-world use cases**:  

- Calling web APIs with `HttpClient`  
- File I/O with async streams  
- Database queries with EF Core  
- Keeping UIs responsive
