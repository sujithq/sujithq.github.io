update_bullets: ["Problem: developers worry about data privacy, restrictive cloud dependencies, and limited control when using remote AI services.", "Solution: local models enable on-device inference so data stays private and workflows are fully customizable.", "Benefits: improved privacy and compliance, lower latency, offline capability, and greater control over model updates and behavior.", "Ideal for: sensitive projects and regulated industries where keeping data on-premises or on-device is required.", "Implication: adopting local models shifts some responsibilities (compute, model management, governance) to the developer or organization while giving back control and flexibility."]

llmSummary: "The post highlights how running AI locally on developers' devices addresses long-standing concerns about data privacy, dependency on cloud services, and limited control over tooling. By using local models, teams — especially those working on sensitive or regulated projects — can keep data on-device, customize workflows, reduce latency, and retain full control over model behavior. The article positions local models as a practical approach for AI-assisted development and is published on the Azure AI Foundry Blog."
