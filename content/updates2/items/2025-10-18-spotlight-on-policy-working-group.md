Led by co-chairs Jim Bugwadia, Poonam Lamba, and Andy Suderman, the group produced documentation, whitepapers, a CNCF survey, and the Policy Reports API, and helped educate the community about built-in policy APIs and CNCF policy tools. The WG coordinated with SIG Auth and SIG Security, faced contributor-time and consensus challenges, and encouraged newcomers to join meetings and review materials to get involved."
