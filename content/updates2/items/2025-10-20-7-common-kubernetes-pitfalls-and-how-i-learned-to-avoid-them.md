update_bullets: ["Set CPU/memory requests and limits (start modest, monitor usage, adjust; use HPA where appropriate).", "Add simple liveness, readiness and startup probes (e.g., an HTTP /healthz) to avoid premature traffic and detect hung containers.", "Centralize logs with Fluentd/Fluent Bit or OpenTelemetry; pair logs with Prometheus metrics and consider Jaeger for tracing.", "Differentiate environments: use kustomize/overlays, separate ConfigMaps/Secrets (Sealed Secrets for confidentiality), and plan for prod scale.", "Label resources with owner/purpose, regularly audit namespaces, enable garbage collection and use policy automation (e.g., Kyverno) to remove stale objects.", "Learn core Kubernetes networking (Pod-to-Pod, ClusterIP, DNS, basic ingress) before adopting service meshes or advanced CNIs; start with a simple ingress controller.", "Harden security: use RBAC with least privilege, pin image versions (avoid :latest), enforce Pod security policies/Admission (Pod Security Admission, Kyverno, OPA Gatekeeper) and avoid running containers as root."]

llmSummary: "The article outlines seven common Kubernetes pitfalls the author encountered—missing resource requests/limits, inadequate liveness/readiness probes, overreliance on kubectl logs, treating dev and prod identically, leaving stale resources, jumping into advanced networking too early, and weak security/RBAC—and gives pragmatic, experience-based advice to avoid each one."
