update_bullets: ["Problem: model calls in Bedrock lack caller context, making it hard to know which bot, service, or user is consuming tokens and driving cost.", "Solution: enrich every Bedrock invocation with structured context (bot ID, team, environment, correlation ID, user ID) so logs and metrics are attributable.", "Implementation pattern: inject context in a centralized layer (API gateway, middleware, or SDK wrapper) to ensure consistency and prevent clients from omitting identifiers.", "Logging: use structured logs (JSON) and include context fields in CloudWatch/CloudTrail logs or forward to a logging/observability platform for aggregation and analysis.", "Observability: create dashboards and alerts for high token usage per bot/team, and use correlation IDs to trace requests end-to-end across services.", "Security & governance: validate and authorize context at the gateway to prevent spoofing; consider RBAC and IAM roles to control who can call models and attribute cost.", "Cost allocation: use the enriched logs to tag usage for billing reports, chargebacks, or quotas per bot or team.", "Privacy & compliance: avoid logging sensitive PII in invocation context or redact/obfuscate sensitive fields before storing logs.", "Operational tips: sample heavy payloads, enforce size limits, and retain only necessary fields to balance observability and cost."]

llmSummary: "The article addresses a common enterprise problem with AWS Bedrock: unknown consumption of AI tokens. It proposes adding explicit bot/user context to model invocation logs so teams can attribute usage, monitor costs, enforce policies, and investigate behavior. The approach uses structured metadata injected at the application or gateway layer and captured in Bedrock invocation logs and downstream observability systems."
