llmSummary: "Azure announced the general availability of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool trigger for Azure Functions. MCP is a protocol that lets applications provide capabilities and context to large language models, including defining tools that AI agents can call. The new trigger makes it easier to expose Azure Functions as MCP tools so LLM-based agents can invoke serverless operations directly."

Azure announced the general availability of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool trigger for Azure Functions. MCP is a protocol that lets applications provide capabilities and context to large language models, including defining tools that AI agents can call. The new trigger makes it easier to expose Azure Functions as MCP tools so LLM-based agents can invoke serverless operations directly.
