update_bullets: ["GA (Standard) features: BackendTLSPolicy (specify TLS from Gateway to backend pods with hostname/SAN and caCertificateRefs or wellKnownCACertificates), supportedFeatures in GatewayClass.status (declare implementation capabilities for automated conformance), and an optional name field for individual route rules to aid status, observability, policies and tooling.", "BackendTLSPolicy details: hostname used for SNI and authentication unless SANs provided (add hostname to SANs to authenticate against it), caCertificateRefs supports up to 8 PEM bundles, or wellKnownCACertificates: \"System\" for implementation trust stores; examples provided in blog.", "SupportedFeatures impact: implementations must populate GatewayClass.status.supportedFeatures when accepting a GatewayClass; conformance tests now run based on that field (no extra flags), with Mesh as a special case for Conformance Profiles.", "Named route rules: adds optional name on xRouteRule types to enable direct referencing from status, policies, metrics/logs, tooling and internal config; name may be immutable or constrained by implementations.", "Experimental: ExternalAuth filter for HTTPRoute (Envoy ext_authz style) supports HTTP or gRPC auth services, forwards configurable headers, returns 200 to allow and 403 to deny, and can add headers for downstream requests.", "Experimental: Mesh (XMesh) resource (gateway.networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1) is cluster-scoped, identifies controllerName, reports accepted status and supportedFeatures; mesh implementations should create a default Mesh on startup to ease adoption.", "Experimental: Default Gateways and Route.useDefaultGateways (All or scoped) let Routes bind to operator-designated default Gateways; Gateways opt into being default via spec.defaultScope; binding recorded in Route.status.parents (not parentRefs) and supports multiple defaults.", "TLS/client certs: new Gateway.spec.tls (GatewayTLSConfig) lets operators set default and perPort TLS client certificate validation to mitigate connection coalescing mTLS bypass; per-port overrides available with TLSPortConfig.", "Breaking changes: GRPCRoute CRD now requires a top-level .spec field (stricter OpenAPI validation); Experimental CORS's allowCredentials now must be a true Boolean per spec (stricter validation).", "Developer/UX improvements: added Kube API Linter in CI, faster CRD tests with envtest, clearer docs marking experimental fields and auto-generated GEP navigation.", "Compatibility and adoption: Gateway API v1.4.0 usable on Kubernetes 1.26+, seven implementations already conformant (Agent Gateway, Airlock, Microgateway, Envoy Gateway, GKE Gateway, Istio kgateway, Traefik Proxy); Getting Started guide available."]

llmSummary: "Gateway API v1.4.0 (released Oct 6, 2025) advances Kubernetes service networking with three features promoted to Standard (BackendTLSPolicy, supportedFeatures in GatewayClass status, and named rule fields for Routes) and several experimental additions (Mesh/XMesh, default Gateways, and an ExternalAuth filter for HTTPRoute). The release also adds per-port TLS/client-certificate configuration to address connection coalescing security, introduces a couple of breaking validation changes, improves CI/docs, and is usable on Kubernetes >=1.26."
