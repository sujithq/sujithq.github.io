## Who I am

This website is a personal blog operated by **Sujith Quintelier**. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by any employer or client.  
**Contact:** `sujith.quintelier@gmail.com`

**Website:** {{< relref "/" >}}  
**Jurisdiction:** European Union (Belgium).

## What personal data I collect and why

This site collects the minimum necessary data. Depending on your interaction with the site, the following may be processed:

- **Consent-based analytics data (Microsoft Clarity)**: If you **accept cookies**, Clarity may record interaction data (e.g., session replays, clicks, scrolls, device/viewport). I use this to improve content and usability (consent, Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR).
- **Contact information (if you write to me)**: Name and email address contained in your message, used to respond (legitimate interest/contract, Art. 6(1)(b)(f) GDPR).

I do **not** sell personal data.

## Cookies & tracking

This site runs **Microsoft Clarity** only after you **give consent** via the cookie banner. Without consent, Clarity is not loaded.

### Microsoft Clarity

- **Provider:** Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052, USA
- **Purpose:** Analytics & user experience improvement (session replays, heatmaps)
- **Data:** Page URLs, referrers, events (click/scroll), device/viewport, and consent status
- **Retention:** Defined by Clarity; I keep aggregated insights as long as useful for UX improvements
- **Legal basis:** Your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR)
- **Opt-out/withdraw:** Use the cookie banner’s **Decline** option or reset your choice via the link below

### Manage your consent

Use this link to reset your cookie choice and re-open the banner:

{{< consent-reset >}}

If you have previously accepted, clicking the reset link will let you **decline** going forward.

## Legal bases I rely on

- **Consent** — for any non-essential cookies/analytics (e.g., Microsoft Clarity)
- **Legitimate interests** — site security, debugging, and essential operations
- **Contract** — when you request something we need to deliver (e.g., replies to messages)
- **Legal obligations** — where retention is required by law

## How I share data

- **Service providers (processors):** Hosting/CDN, analytics (Microsoft Clarity). These providers process data on my behalf in line with their terms and applicable law.
- **Legal compliance:** I may disclose data if required by law or to protect rights and safety.

**International transfers:** Microsoft may process data in the United States and other regions. I rely on appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) provided by the vendor. See the provider’s privacy documentation for details.

## Data retention

- **Analytics (Clarity):** retained per provider defaults; I keep aggregate insights as long as necessary for UX improvements.
- **Contact emails:** kept as long as needed to respond and for reasonable record-keeping.

I periodically review and minimise retention.

## Your rights (GDPR)

You have the right to:

- Access and obtain a copy of your personal data
- Rectify inaccurate or incomplete data
- Erase data ("right to be forgotten"), where applicable
- Restrict or object to processing, including profiling
- Data portability
- Withdraw consent at any time (does not affect past lawful processing)
- Lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (in Belgium: **Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit / Autorité de protection des données**)

To exercise rights, contact me at the email above.

## Security

I use reasonable administrative, technical, and organisational measures to protect your data. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; residual risk remains.

## Changes to this policy

I may update this policy to reflect changes to the site, services, or law. Material changes will be highlighted.
