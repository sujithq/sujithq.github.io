## Hugo Blog Specifications

### Front Matter Format (TOML)
```toml
+++
title = 'Engaging Title with Emoji (≤50 chars)'
slug = 'descriptive-slug-matching-folder'
date = '2025-MM-DD HH:MM:SSZ'
lastmod = '2025-MM-DD HH:MM:SSZ'
draft = true
tags = [
  "Azure",
  "DevOps", 
  "GitHub",
  ".NET",
  "Terraform",
  "Platform Engineering",
  "Specific Technology"
]
categories = [
  "Cloud Computing",
  "Development Tools",
  "Infrastructure",
  ".NET Development",
  "Infrastructure as Code",
  "Platform Engineering"
]
series = [
  "Tutorial Series Name" 
]

layout = "single"
[params]
    cover = true
    author = "sujith"
    cover_prompt = '''Create a clean, modern technical illustration for a blog post about [POST TOPIC]. 
    Use a professional, minimalist design with [RELEVANT TECHNOLOGY] branding colors. 
    Include visual elements representing [KEY CONCEPTS] with modern icons and geometric shapes. 
    Add subtle tech patterns (circuit lines, network nodes, etc.) and ensure the style appeals to 
    cloud engineers and developers. Include small labels for key features and maintain a 
    futuristic, enterprise-ready aesthetic.'''
    
description = "Concise summary explaining what readers will learn (≤150 chars)"
+++
```

### Critical Frontmatter Requirements (Lessons Learned)
- **Date Format**: Always use `'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SSZ'` format with 'Z' suffix, not timezone offsets
- **Current Dates Only**: Folder dates must be current or future - never use past dates for new posts
- **Draft Status**: Always set `draft = true` - posts should not be published immediately when created
- **Quote Consistency**: Use double quotes for `layout = "single"` and `author = "sujith"`
- **Spacing**: Maintain proper blank line before description in params section
- **Folder Naming**: Must match date in frontmatter exactly: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-slug`

### Taxonomy Standards (Production Validated)
**✅ ALLOWED in Categories and Tags:**
- Spaces: `"Cloud Computing"`, `"Development Tools"`, `"GitHub Actions"`
- Hyphens: `"Multi-Factor Authentication"`, `"Role-Based Access Control"`, `"AI-Powered Development"`
- Alphanumeric: `"Azure"`, `"DevOps"`, `"GitHub"`, `"DotNET"`
- Periods: `".NET"`

**❌ FORBIDDEN in Categories and Tags (Causes URL Issues):**
- Parentheses: `"Infrastructure as Code (IaC)"` → Use `"Infrastructure as Code - IaC"`
- Ampersands: `"AI & Machine Learning"` → Split into `"AI"` + `"Machine Learning"`
- Hash symbols: `"C#"` → Use `"CSharp"`
- Forward slashes: `"CI/CD"` → Use `"CI CD"`

**Hugo URL Generation Rules:**
- Hugo converts special characters to double hyphens: `&` → `--`
- External link generators use single hyphens, causing 404 errors
- Clean taxonomy prevents `/categories/ai-machine-learning/` vs `/categories/ai--machine-learning/` mismatches

**Production Examples (Fixed):**
```toml
# ❌ BEFORE (Caused 404s)
categories = ["Infrastructure as Code (IaC)", "AI & Machine Learning"]
tags = ["C#", ".NET", "CI/CD"]

# ✅ AFTER (Clean URLs)
categories = ["Infrastructure as Code", "IaC", "AI", "Machine Learning"] 
tags = ["CSharp", ".NET", "CI CD"]
```

### Content Patterns
- **Folder Structure**: `content/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-slug/index.md`
- **Images**: Place `cover.jpg` in the same folder for auto-detection
- **Code Blocks**: Use proper language identifiers (bash, yaml, json, csharp, powershell, hcl, etc.)
- **Internal Links**: Reference related posts using Hugo's relref shortcode
- **External Links**: Always link to official documentation

### Cover Image Generation
- **Microsoft Designer Prompts**: Store detailed prompts in `cover_prompt` front matter field
- **Style Guidelines**: Clean, modern, professional technical illustrations
- **Visual Elements**: Use technology-specific branding colors and modern icons
- **Content Integration**: Include visual representations of key concepts and workflows
- **Technical Aesthetic**: Incorporate subtle tech patterns (circuits, networks, geometric shapes)
- **Target Audience**: Appeal to cloud engineers, developers, and IT professionals
- **Consistency**: Maintain futuristic, enterprise-ready design language
- **Prompt Structure**: Include specific technology, key concepts, visual style, and target audience

### Common Topic Categories
