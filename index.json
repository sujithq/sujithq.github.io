Redundancy ensures that your storage account meets its availability and durability targets even in the face of failures.\nRedundancy Primary Region Data in an Azure Storage account is always replicated three times in the primary region. Azure Storage offers two options for how your data is replicated in the primary region:\nLRS ZRS LRS Copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region. LRS is the least expensive replication option, but isn’t recommended for applications requiring high availability or durability.\nZRS Copies your data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region. For applications requiring high availability, Microsoft recommends using ZRS in the primary region, and also replicating to a secondary region.\nRedundancy Secondary Region For applications requiring high durability, you can choose to additionally copy the data in your storage account to a secondary region that is hundreds of miles away from the primary region. If your storage account is copied to a secondary region, then your data is durable even in the case of a complete regional outage or a disaster in which the primary region isn’t recoverable.\nWhen you create a storage account, you select the primary region for the account. The paired secondary region is determined based on the primary region, and can’t be changed.\nAzure Storage offers two options for copying your data to a secondary region:\nGRS GZRS The primary difference between GRS and GZRS is how data is replicated in the primary region. Within the secondary region, data is always replicated synchronously three times using LRS. LRS in the secondary region protects your data against hardware failures.\nGRS Copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region using LRS. It then copies your data asynchronously to a single physical location in the secondary region. Within the secondary region, your data is copied synchronously three times using LRS.\nGZRS Copies your data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region using ZRS. It then copies your data asynchronously to a single physical location in the secondary region. Within the secondary region, your data is copied synchronously three times using LRS.\nRead access to data in the secondary region Geo-redundant storage (with GRS or GZRS) replicates your data to another physical location in the secondary region to protect against regional outages. With an account configured for GRS or GZRS, data in the secondary region is not directly accessible to users or applications, unless a failover occurs. The failover process updates the DNS entry provided by Azure Storage so that the secondary endpoint becomes the new primary endpoint for your storage account. During the failover process, your data is inaccessible. After the failover is complete, you can read and write data to the new primary region.\nIf your applications require high availability, then you can configure your storage account for read access to the secondary region. When you enable read access to the secondary region, then your data is always available to be read from the secondary, including in a situation where the primary region becomes unavailable. Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) or read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS) configurations permit read access to the secondary region.\nBecause data is replicated asynchronously from the primary to the secondary region, the secondary region is typically behind the primary region in terms of write operations. If a disaster were to strike the primary region, it’s likely that some data would be lost.\nSummaries Durability and availability parameters Parameter LRS ZRS (RA-)GRS (RA-)GZRS Percent durability of objects over a given year at least 11 9’s at least 12 9’s at least 16 9’s at least 16 9’s Availability for read requests At least 99.9% (99% for Cool or Archive access tiers) At least 99.9% (99% for Cool or Archive access tiers) At least 99.9% (99% for Cool or Archive access tiers) for GRS At least 99.99% (99.9% for Cool or Archive access tiers) for RA-GRS At least 99.9% (99% for Cool or Archive access tiers) for GZRS At least 99.99% (99.9% for Cool or Archive access tiers) for RA-GZRS Availability for write requests At least 99.9% (99% for Cool or Archive access tiers) At least 99.9% (99% for Cool or Archive access tiers) At least 99.9% (99% for Cool or Archive access tiers) At least 99.9% (99% for Cool or Archive access tiers) Number of copies of data maintained on separate nodes Three copies within a single region Three copies across separate availability zones within a single region Six copies total, including three in the primary region and three in …","date":1679292e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679292e3,"objectID":"b3870722cb32ff74247308fc0b540ef4","permalink":"/post/2023-03-20-lrs-zrs-ra-grs-ra-gzrs/","publishdate":"2023-03-20T06:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2023-03-20-lrs-zrs-ra-grs-ra-gzrs/","section":"post","summary":"Azure Storage redundancy options","tags":["Azure","Azure Storage","RTO","RPO","HA","Redundancy"],"title":"Azure Storage redundancy","type":"post"},{"authors":["sujith"],"categories":["Azure","Load Balancing","Networking"],"content":"The term load balancing refers to the even distribution of workloads (that is, incoming network traffic), across a group of backend computing resources or servers. Load balancing aims to optimize resource use, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overloading any single resource. It can also improve availability by sharing a workload across redundant computing resources.\nOptions Azure Load Balancer Traffic Manager Azure Application Gateway Azure Front Door Azure Load Balancer High-performance, ultra-low-latency Layer 4 load-balancing service (inbound and outbound) for all UDP and TCP protocols. It is built to handle millions of requests per second while ensuring your solution is highly available. Azure Load Balancer is zone-redundant, ensuring high availability across Availability Zones.\nType They can be public (aka external) or internal (aka private).\nPublic - Provide outbound connections for virtual machines (VMs) inside your virtual network. These connections are accomplished by translating their private IP addresses to public IP addresses. External load balancers are used to distribute client traffic from the internet across your VMs. That internet traffic might come from web browsers, module apps, or other sources.\nInternal - Is used where private IPs are needed at the frontend only. Internal load balancers are used to load balance traffic from internal Azure resources to other Azure resources inside a virtual network. A load balancer frontend can also be accessed from an on-premises network in a hybrid scenario.\nAvailability zones Azure Load Balancer can be either zone redundant, zonal or non-zonal.\nZone redundant - The traffic s served by a single IP address and it survives zone failure. The frontend IP may be used to reach all non-impacted backend pool members no matter the zone. One or more availability zones can fail and the data path survives as long as one zone in the region remains healthy.\nZonal - The frontend is guaranteed to a single zone. Any inbound or outbound flow is served by a single zone in a region. Your frontend shares fate with the health of the zone. The data path is unaffected by failures in zones other than where it was guaranteed. You can use zonal front-ends to expose an IP address per Availability Zone.\nAdditionally, the use of zonal front-ends directly for load balanced endpoints within each zone is supported. You can use this configuration to expose per zone load-balanced endpoints to individually monitor each zone. For public endpoints, you can integrate them with a DNS load-balancing product like Traffic Manager and use a single DNS name.\nSKU There are 2 SKUs available: Standard and basic.\nFeatures Standard Load Balancer Basic Load Balancer Backend pool size Supports up to 1000 instances. Supports up to 300 instances. Backend pool endpoints Any virtual machines or virtual machine scale sets in a single virtual network. Virtual machines in a single availability set or virtual machine scale set. Health probes TCP, HTTP, HTTPS TCP, HTTP Health probe down behavior TCP connections stay alive on an instance probe down and on all probes down. TCP connections stay alive on an instance probe down. All TCP connections end when all probes are down. Availability Zones Zone-redundant and zonal front-ends for inbound and outbound traffic. Not available Diagnostics Azure Monitor multi-dimensional metrics Azure Monitor logs HA Ports Available for Internal Load Balancer Not available Secure by default Closed to inbound flows unless allowed by a network security group.

Because Traffic Manager is a DNS-based load-balancing service, it load-balances only at the domain level. For that reason, it can’t fail over as quickly as Front Door, because of common challenges around DNS caching and systems not honoring DNS time-to-live values (TTLs).\nThe client sends a DNS query to its configured recursive DNS service to resolve the name ‘partners.contoso.com’. A recursive DNS service, sometimes called a ’local DNS’ service, does not host DNS domains directly. Rather, the client off-loads the work of contacting the various authoritative DNS services across the Internet needed to resolve a DNS name.\nTo resolve the DNS name, the recursive DNS service finds the name servers for the ‘contoso.com’ domain. It then contacts those name servers to request the ‘partners.contoso.com’ DNS record.

The course covers the process of designing, implementing, and managing core Azure networking infrastructure, Hybrid Networking connections, load balancing traffic, network routing, private access to Azure services, network security and monitoring.\nVirtual Networks Capabilities Communication with the internet Communication between Azure resources Communication between on-premises resources Filtering network traffic Routing network traffic Address spaces to be used 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix) 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix) 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix) Subnets Azure reserves 5 IP addresses within each subnet.\nx.x.x.0: Network address x.x.x.1: Reserved by Azure for the default gateway x.x.x.2, x.x.x.3: Reserved by Azure to map the Azure DNS IPs to the VNet space x.x.x.255: Network broadcast address Scopes All Azure resource types have a scope that defines the level that resource names must be unique. A resource must have a unique name within its scope. There are four levels you can specify a scope:\nGlobal (Azure Storage Account) Management Group Subscription Resource Group (Azure Virtual Network) Resource Regions and Subscriptions A resource can be created in a virtual network in the same region and subscription but virtual network can be connected from different subscriptions and regions\nAvailability Zones An Azure Availability Zone enables you to define unique physical locations within a region. Each zone is made up of one or more data centers equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. Designed to ensure high-availability of your Azure services, the physical separation of Availability Zones within a region protects applications and data from data center failures.\nZonal services: Resources can be pinned to a specific zone Zone-Redundant services: Resources are replicated across zones automatically Non-Regional services: services are always available and are resilient to zone-wide and region-wide outages. Public IP Public IP addresses enable Internet resources to communicate with Azure resources and enable Azure resources to communicate outbound with Internet and public-facing Azure services. A public IP address in Azure is dedicated to a specific resource, until it’s unassigned by a network engineer. A resource without a public IP assigned can communicate outbound through network address translation services, where Azure dynamically assigns an available IP address that isn’t dedicated to the resource.\nA dynamic public IP address is an assigned address that can change over the lifespan of the Azure resource. The dynamic IP address is allocated when you create or start a VM. The IP address is released when you stop or delete the VM. In each Azure region, public IP addresses are assigned from a unique pool of addresses. The default allocation method is dynamic. A static public IP address is an assigned address that will not change over the lifespan of the Azure resource. To ensure that the IP address for the resource remains the same, set the allocation method explicitly to static. In this case, an IP address is assigned immediately. It is released only when you delete the resource or change the IP allocation method to dynamic. Basic SKU: can be assigned by using static or dynamic allocation methods, are open by default, use of NSG is recommended but optional for restricting inbound or outbound traffic. Assignable to to any Azure resource that can be assigned a public IP address, such as network interfaces, VPN gateways, application gateways, and internet-facing load balancers. Availability zone scenarios not supported Standard SKU: always use the static allocation method, are secure by default and closed to inbound traffic, must explicitly allow inbound traffic by using a NSG. Assignable to network interfaces, Standard public load balancers, application gateways, or VPN gateways. Zone-redundant by default and optionally zonal (they can be created zonal and guaranteed in a specific availability zone). DNS resolutions Depending on how you use Azure to host IaaS, PaaS, and hybrid solutions, you might need to allow the virtual machines (VMs), and other resources deployed in a virtual network to communicate with each other. Although you can enable communication by using IP addresses, it is much simpler to use names that can be easily remembered, and do not change.\nDNS is split into two areas: Public, and Private DNS for resources accessible from your own internal networks.\nPublic DNS Services Public DNS services resolve names and IP addresses for resources and services accessible over the internet such as web servers.

Let it build with Teamcity and deploy it with Octopus Deploy. The needed Azure Resources will also be deployed.\nSetup Tools Visual Studio 2017 v15.7.4 (VS). TeamCity v2017.2.4 (TC). Octopus Deploy v2018.6.2 (OD). For this purpose I deployed a Azure VM using this [template] (https://portal.azure.com/#create/octopus.octopusdeployoctopus-deploy), installed an OD Tentacle, a TC Agent and OD cli (in C:\\Programs\\Octo). OD downloads can be found [here] (https://octopus.com/downloads). Also install the correct .NET version via this [link] (https://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx) and set the DOTNET_HOME environment variable in TC to C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\\nMake sure you have installed the Azure development workload in VS. Check via TOOLS\\Get Tools and Features… On Workloads tab check Azure development\nCreate We use VS for developing the Function. Store the project in a source control system supported by TC.\nFunction Add new Project, search for Azure Functions and give it a name. It is a basic http trigger. Nothing fancy. Modify if needed.\nInstall Nuget package Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions.\nARM Template Deploying an Azure Function needs 3 Azure Resources:\nStorage Account (Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts) Hosting Plan (Microsoft.Web/serverfarms) Function App (Microsoft.Web/sites) Below you will find a basic ARM Template with these 3 resources and a parameters Template. Set Copy to Output Directory to Copy if Newer.
