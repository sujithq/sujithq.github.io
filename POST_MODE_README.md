# Post Mode Setup Instructions

## What I've Created

I've created a comprehensive "Post Mode" chat mode specifically designed for your sujithq.github.io blog. This mode combines the autonomous capabilities of Beast Mode with specialized knowledge about your blog's structure, writing style, and technical focus areas.

cp ".github/chatmodes/Post.chatmode.md" "$env:APPDATA/Code/User/prompts/Post.chatmode.md"
```

### Alternative manual method

1. Navigate to: `C:\Users\SujithQuintelier\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\prompts\`
2. Copy the file `Post.chatmode.md` from your `.github/chatmodes/` folder
