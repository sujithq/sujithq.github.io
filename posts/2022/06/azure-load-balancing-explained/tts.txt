What is Load Balancing?
Load balancing is the even distribution of network traffic across a group of backend computing resources or servers. The primary goals of load balancing are:
- Optimizing resource utilization
- Maximizing throughput & performance
- Minimizing response time
- Ensuring high availability
- Preventing overload on a single resource

In Azure, there are multiple load-balancing options, each designed for different traffic types and use cases.

Azure Load Balancing Options
Service | Scope | Recommended for | Layer
- Azure Load Balancer | Regional | Non-HTTP(S) workloads | Layer 4
- Traffic Manager | Global | DNS-based traffic routing | Layer 7 (DNS)
- Azure Application Gateway | Regional | HTTP(S) web traffic | Layer 7
- Azure Front Door | Global | Web applications, API acceleration | Layer 7

Azure Load Balancer (ALB)
Azure Load Balancer is a Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) load-balancing service designed for high-performance and ultra-low-latency traffic. It efficiently distributes inbound and outbound traffic while ensuring high availability across Availability Zones.
Types of Azure Load Balancers:
- Public Load Balancer: Distributes internet-facing traffic across VMs in a VNet.
- Internal Load Balancer: Distributes private network traffic within Azure.
Availability Zone Configurations:
- Zone Redundant: Uses a single IP, surviving zone failures.
- Zonal: Restricts traffic to a specific zone.
Standard vs. Basic Load Balancer:
- Standard: 1000 VMs, TCP/HTTP/HTTPS health probes, secure by default, HA Ports, 99.99% SLA
- Basic: 300 VMs, TCP/HTTP health probes, not secure by default, no HA Ports, no SLA

Azure Traffic Manager (ATM)
Traffic Manager is a DNS-based global load balancer, designed to distribute traffic across multiple Azure regions. It does not directly route trafficâ€”instead, it resolves requests to the nearest healthy backend.
How It Works:
1. A client requests a domain (e.g., app.contoso.com).
2. The DNS system redirects to contoso.trafficmanager.net.
3. Traffic Manager selects a backend using health checks & routing rules.
4. The client receives the IP of the closest, available backend and connects directly.
Routing Methods:
- Priority: Primary backend with failover options.
- Weighted: Distribute traffic based on weights.
- Performance: Route traffic to the closest backend.
- Geographic: Route traffic based on user location.
- MultiValue: Return multiple healthy endpoints.
- Subnet: Route based on user IP ranges.
Traffic Manager is ideal for:
- Failover between Azure regions
- Multi-region deployments
- Hybrid cloud environments

Azure Application Gateway (APG)
Application Gateway is a Layer 7 load balancer designed specifically for HTTP(S) traffic. It provides advanced web traffic routing, SSL offloading, and Web Application Firewall (WAF) integration.
Key Features:
- Path-based routing: Direct requests to different backends based on URL paths.
- Session affinity: Keep users connected to the same backend server.
- SSL Termination: Offload SSL decryption to reduce backend CPU usage.
- Autoscaling: Dynamically scale based on traffic load.
Best for:
- Web applications that require advanced traffic routing.
- Security-conscious deployments using WAF protection.

Azure Front Door (AFD)
Azure Front Door is a global Layer 7 service that combines load balancing, caching, acceleration, and security into one solution. It ensures high availability and low-latency for web applications.
Key Capabilities:
- Global HTTP(S) load balancing: Route traffic to the nearest healthy region.
- SSL offloading & URL rewriting: Enhance security & performance.
- Caching & acceleration: Reduce latency via Edge locations.
- DDoS Protection & WAF: Secure web apps from threats.
Front Door vs. Traffic Manager:
- Front Door: Routes traffic in real-time based on latency.
- Traffic Manager: Routes via DNS resolution, which is slower due to caching.
Best for:
- Global applications that need low latency.
- Web APIs requiring intelligent traffic routing.

Global vs. Regional Load Balancing
Service | Scope | Use Case
- Azure Front Door | Global | HTTP(S) traffic acceleration & load balancing.
- Traffic Manager | Global | DNS-based traffic routing.
- Application Gateway | Regional | Web application load balancing.
- Azure Load Balancer | Regional | Non-HTTP(S) workloads.
When to Choose Which?
Scenario | Recommended Service
- Distribute global HTTP(S) traffic: Azure Front Door
- Route traffic between regions via DNS: Traffic Manager
- Load balance internal traffic within Azure: Azure Load Balancer
- Optimize web application performance: Azure Application Gateway

Final Thoughts
Azure offers multiple load balancing solutions, each designed for specific traffic types, regions, and use cases. Whether you're building a global web application or optimizing regional traffic, choosing the right service is key to maximizing performance, availability, and security.
Summary:
- Use Front Door for global web acceleration.
- Use Traffic Manager for DNS-based failover.
- Use Application Gateway for web app security & routing.
- Use Azure Load Balancer for high-performance, low-latency workloads.
