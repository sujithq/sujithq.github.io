Choosing the right AI model for your GitHub Copilot project can be tricky. Each model has its own strengths, and understanding which one fits your needs best can make a big difference.

As of July 31, 2025, hereâ€™s the current landscape:
- For a balance of cost and performance: GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4, or Claude 3.5 Sonnet are solid choices.
- For fast, lightweight tasks: o4-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini 2.0 Flash work well.
- For deep reasoning or complex debugging: Claude Opus 4, Claude Sonnet 4, o3, or Gemini 2.5 Pro are ideal.
- For multimodal inputs (like images): Gemini 2.0 Flash or GPT-4.1 are your go-to options.

Prioritizing speed:
- o4-mini: Fast, efficient, and cost-effective. Best for rapid prototyping, explaining small code snippets, learning new concepts, and generating boilerplate code.
- Consider other models for multi-file or deep reasoning tasks.

Balanced AI models:
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Reliable all-rounder for writing documentation, answering language-specific questions, and generating concise code snippets.
- GPT-4.1: Versatile performer for explaining code blocks, writing comments, generating reusable code, and handling multilingual prompts.

Models for complex projects:
- Claude Sonnet 4: Problem solver for refactoring large codebases, planning complex architectures, and designing algorithms.
- Claude Opus 4: Advanced problem solver for full functions, classes, multi-file logic, debugging, and analyzing complex architectures.
- Gemini 2.5 Pro: Advanced researcher for scientific data, multi-file logic, and complex debugging.
- o3: Precision expert for optimizing performance-critical code, debugging, writing structured code, and summarizing logs.

Multimodal capabilities:
- Gemini 2.0 Flash: Visual problem-solver for diagrams, UI mockups, front-end development, and layout debugging.

Final thoughts:
The key to choosing the right model is matching it to the task at hand. Experimentation is the best way to learn and refine your approach.
