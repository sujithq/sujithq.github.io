GitHub Copilot Agent Mode is rolling out to all users of Visual Studio Code, including the stable release. Agent Mode enables Copilot to understand your workspace and perform complex, multi-step tasks—from generating code to fixing bugs, running tests, editing multiple files, and executing terminal commands.

What is Copilot Agent Mode?
Agent Mode is a major upgrade to GitHub Copilot. Unlike traditional autocomplete and inline suggestions, Agent Mode enables Copilot to perform tasks such as:
- Refactor legacy code to modern frameworks
- Bootstrap applications from scratch
- Write and execute tests, then fix failing ones
- Generate documentation for existing code
- Integrate new libraries and modify config files
- Suggest code edits across multiple files

How Does It Work?
Agent Mode uses workspace search, code edits, terminal commands, and context awareness to break down your request, reason about next steps, and execute them iteratively.

How To Enable It in VS Code:
1. Enable Agent Mode in Settings: 'GitHub > Copilot: Enable Chat Agent Mode'
2. Open Copilot Chat
3. Switch to Agent Mode in the chat dropdown
4. Type your task and let Copilot work

When to Use Agent Mode (vs. Edit Mode):
- Use Agent Mode for multi-file, iterative, or terminal tasks
- Use Edit Mode for focused changes to a single file or snippet

What’s Coming Next?
- Better undo support
- Improved terminal visibility and error feedback
- Notebook integration for Jupyter workflows
- More granular context control

Final Thoughts:
GitHub Copilot Agent Mode is a glimpse into the future of software development. It’s a collaborator that understands your code, runs it, tests it, and fixes it. Fire up Visual Studio Code, switch on Agent Mode, and start building with your AI teammate.
