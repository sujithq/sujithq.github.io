Terraform is a powerful Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that enables you to define, provision, and manage Azure resources using declarative configuration files. This blog series, Zero to Hero: Terraform for Azure, will take you through Terraform from the basics to advanced topics, using hands-on examples tailored for Azure.

In this first post, we focus on setting up your development environment and deploying your first resource on Azure using Terraform.

Prerequisites:
- An Azure account (a free account works fine)
- Basic knowledge of Azure (nice to have, but not required)

Setup options:
1. Local installation (best for long-term development)
2. Using Docker (best for isolated environments)

Local Installation:
- Download Terraform for your OS and verify installation with 'terraform version'.
- Install Azure CLI for authentication and resource management. Verify with 'az version'.
- Install Visual Studio Code and the Terraform extension.

Using Docker:
- Install Docker.
- Run Terraform inside a container.
- Mount a volume to work with local files.

Authenticating with Azure:
- Login using Azure CLI: 'az login'.
- Set the desired subscription: 'az account set --subscription <subscription-id>'.
- For automation, use a Service Principal: 'az ad sp create-for-rbac --name terraform-sp --role Contributor --scopes /subscriptions/<subscription-id> --sdk-auth'.

Writing Your First Terraform Configuration:
- Initialize a Terraform project: 'mkdir terraform-azure && cd terraform-azure'.
- Create a new Terraform file: 'touch main.tf'.
- Define the Terraform configuration in 'main.tf'.
- Initialize Terraform: 'terraform init'.
- Preview changes: 'terraform plan'.
- Apply the configuration: 'terraform apply -auto-approve'.

Cleaning Up and Next Steps:
- Remove deployed resources: 'terraform destroy -auto-approve'.
- Next steps: In Part 2, explore Terraform state management and remote backends.
